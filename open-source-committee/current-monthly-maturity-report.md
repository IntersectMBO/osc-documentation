# ðŸ“ˆ Current Monthly Maturity Report

### Summary

In **March 2025**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem demonstrated **sustained development velocity**, with strong contributor participation, fast QA response cycles, and a major uptick in code volume. While overall growth moderated compared to Februaryâ€™s historic spikes, the month still marked one of the most **productive and responsive periods** in recent reporting history.

Major contributors like **IOHK** significantly scaled up, while others such as **BinarApps** and **Sireto Technology** tapered off â€” indicating a possible shift in delivery responsibility or transition of project phases. The volume of modified code soared, especially in core repos like **Cardano-ledger**, **Plutus**, and **Cardano-api**.

PRs, issues, and modified files all rose, and contributors across most time zones improved their delivery pace. Most notably, issue resolution time dropped from **9.2 to just 3.2 days**, showcasing exceptional engineering responsiveness.

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions

* **IOHK** led with 990 commits and 1,154 authors â€” marking a 24% contributor increase and affirming its role as the primary driver of ecosystem development.
* **BinarApps** and **Sireto** scaled back by 33â€“54%, suggesting either project conclusion or strategic reallocation.
* Author contributions remained stable for **Well-Typed** and **Unknown**, reinforcing continuity among external and unaffiliated teams.

#### Geographic Distribution

* **Central Europe (UTC +1)** remained the most active timezone, though activity declined modestly.
* **UTC 0 and +2** saw notable increases in commits, suggesting diversification in regional contribution sources.
* **India and Central Asia** **(UTC +5)** fell off sharply, reversing prior gains.

#### Repository Activity

* **Plutus** surged by +229%, signaling a renewed push in smart contract delivery.
* **Cardano-ledger** and **Cardano-api** saw large increases in estimated file changes â€” likely tied to architectural updates or integration enhancements.
* **Govtool** saw reduced code activity but remained the most QA-tested repo.

#### Code Volume

* Over **1.16 million lines were added**, and **747K removed**, making March one of the highest months on record for code throughput.
* Total modified files rose 38% to 13,673, confirming large-scale updates across the ecosystem.

#### Issue Lifecycle

* 224 issues submitted (+18%) across 19 repos, with **resolution time falling to 3.2 days** â€” a 65% improvement.
* Top QA repos included **Govtool**, **Plutus**, and **Cardano-node**, with feedback turnaround faster than ever.

#### Pull Requests

* 556 PRs submitted (+5.3%), by 67 contributors across 28 repos â€” sustaining the post-February velocity and confirming deep integration and delivery effort.

### Conclusion

**March 2025** reflected a **well-coordinated, high-performing open-source environment**. Code volume was high, QA cycles accelerated, and contributor engagement remained strong. IOHKâ€™s scaling played a major role, but broader organizational input and fast feedback resolution confirmed ecosystem maturity.

As the Cardano community enters Q2 2025, the challenge will be to **sustain this velocity**, enable wider participation from emerging orgs, and ensure robustness across the most critical infrastructure layers.
