# üìà Current Monthly Maturity Report

#### Summary

In **September 2025**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem continued its transition into a stabilization and refinement phase following August. Overall contributions moderated across most activity metrics, signaling the close of large-scale delivery cycles and the start of sustained optimization. **Commits declined** modestly **(‚àí9.4%)**, **pull requests dipped** slightly **(‚àí7.3%)**, and **issues decreased** **(‚àí13.9%)** as teams shifted focus from feature expansion to performance tuning, QA, and documentation improvements.

Despite this normalization, ecosystem participation remained strong. **IOHK** continued to anchor Cardano‚Äôs engineering output, maintaining the highest contribution share. **Intersect MBO** sustained its open-source delivery cadence, integrating governance-related and infrastructure workstreams into the broader ecosystem. **Unknown** contributors expanded their presence **(+7.3%)**, further advancing Cardano‚Äôs ongoing decentralization of development.

Governance-related repositories **(govtool)** remained among the most active, while **cardano-ledger**, **plutus**, and **cardano-api** continued steady throughput on protocol and tooling enhancements. Contributor participation remained globally distributed, with a surge in **UTC +10** (Asia-Pacific) offsetting lighter output from the Americas.

#### General Observations

Organizational Contributions

* **IOHK** led with 1,018 total contributions **(‚àí6.8%)** and 47 active authors, sustaining its ecosystem leadership.
* **Intersect MBO** maintained consistent output **(‚àí5.3%)**, demonstrating operational maturity in its open-source integration.
* **Unknown** contributors increased **+7.3%**, reinforcing continued community growth and decentralization.
* **Tweag (‚àí5.3%)** and **Well-Typed (‚àí3.3%)** recorded marginal slowdowns, consistent with a consolidation phase after earlier delivery spikes.

Repository Activity

* **govtool (‚àí5.7%)** and **plutus (‚àí7.4%)** remained top activity centers, indicating continued investment in governance tooling and smart contract infrastructure.
* **cardano-ledger (‚àí9.5%)** and **ouroboros-consensus (‚àí4.8%)** sustained strong protocol-level engagement.
* **formal-ledger-specifications (‚àí11.1%)** continued trending downward slightly as it transitioned into verification and maintenance stages.

\


Pull Requests

* **406 PRs** were submitted (‚àí7.3%) across 26 repositories by 65 contributors.
* **IOHK** remained dominant with 269 PRs (‚àí6.6%), while **Intersect MBO** (62 PRs) and **Unknown** contributors (38 PRs) sustained stable participation.
* **Liqwid Labs** and community contributors posted modest gains, reflecting consistent decentralized activity.

Issue Lifecycle

* **Total issues** declined to 118 (‚àí13.9%) with faster median resolution times (‚àí4.9%), reflecting increased QA efficiency.
* **IOHK** continued leading issue creation and resolution, while ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù contributors expanded engagement by +33%.
* Governance-related projects (**govtool**) showed improved turnaround, signaling process maturity.

Contributor Participation

* The active contributor base remained stable at 85 (‚àí2.3%), with participation distributed across all major organizations and independent contributors.&#x20;
* The sustained global footprint across **UTC ‚àí7 to +10** underscores Cardano‚Äôs resilient, multi-regional engineering ecosystem.

Geographic Representation

* &#x20;**UTC +10** posted the strongest growth (+40.3%), reflecting renewed activity from Asia-Pacific contributors.
* **UTC +1** and **+2** remained consistent, maintaining Europe‚Äôs core engineering presence.
* North and South American zones (**UTC ‚àí5 to ‚àí3)** moderated following two months of accelerated activity, marking a balanced global distribution.

#### Conclusion

**September 2025** represented a consolidation period following two high-velocity development cycles. The Cardano open-source ecosystem sustained **broad participation**, **efficient collaboration**, and **strong output** across key repositories, even as overall volumes normalized. **IOHK** continued to provide technical depth, **Intersect MBO** demonstrated sustained operational maturity, and **community contributors expanded their footprint** ‚Äî collectively reinforcing the ecosystem‚Äôs decentralization and structural resilience.

Cardano closed Q3 2025 with measurable stability and balanced contributor engagement, better positioning the ecosystem for continued momentum entering Q4.
