# OSC Engagement

### Meeting Minutes:

Minutes from each meeting are transcribed via Google Meet. They are reviewed and edited to align with proper speech and the relative conversation. Once complete it is passed through Gemini and formatted in a three-column table that highlights the Topic, Notes of what was discussed, and any applicable action items.&#x20;

Meeting Minutes are updated in the Active Notes file attached to the Meeting Invite and posted publicly in GitBook. (Also viewable in GitHub)

### Meeting Agenda:

The agenda is discussed and set by the Committee Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, and OSO Rep. Once the agenda has been set, a screenshot is added to the meeting invite, and is shared in the Discord and Slack channels. Newly adopted, Each weekâ€™s agenda will also be transcribed into the Committee Space ClickUp.

### Meeting Schedule:

&#x20;Open Source Committee meetings are held every other week on Thursdays:\
&#x20;6am PST/ 8am CST/ 2pm UTC.&#x20;

Meeting cadence is subject to change due to OSO events or National Holidays.&#x20;
