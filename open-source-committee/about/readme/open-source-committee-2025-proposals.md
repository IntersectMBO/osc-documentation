* Incident Response Team: Funds a dedicated 24/7 team to manage security incidents and ensure rapid response capabilities.
* Stipend Programs for Education and Governance: Supports educational stipends and full-time internships for 20 students, fostering talent development and expanding the pool of skilled contributors.
* Committee Member Stipends: Compensation for Members elected to OSC.
* Legal, Design, and Community Services: Enhances project compliance, design innovation, and community engagement across Cardano open-source initiatives.

The proposal has been put together via community input, drawing from the insights of working groups, technical experts, and open-source developers. A full list of programs and activities included in this budget request can be found in the Open Source Committee knowledge base.

Approval of these proposals will empower the Cardano open-source community to continue its growth, ensure project sustainability, and maintain the high standards of innovation and development that define the ecosystem.

The Open Source Committee, working in conjunction with the Budget Committee, Open Source Office, and various Intersect working groups, has put forward a budget proposal for its core 2025 budget. This funding will enable a wide range of essential initiatives to promote and sustain open-source development within the Cardano ecosystem. The committee strongly believes that this budget will allow a broad number of important objectives and initiatives to be undertaken.
