# Open Source Committee Charter 2025

### What is the Open Source Committee (OSC)?

The Open Source Committee (OSC) is a decision-making committee that brings together relevant stakeholders from within the Cardano Ecosystem. The purpose of the OSC is to use the knowledge and observations of these committee members in order to provide guidance, support, and oversight for Intersect's open source initiatives, ensuring alignment with overall business objectives.

The Open Source Committee acts autonomously supervising and directing actions of Intersect’s Open Source Office (OSO). The OSO oversees the management of Intersect maintained projects (Repositories, Teams, & Security), also the methods and processes of the open source development life-cycle.&#x20;

The OSC is responsible to handle any dispute resolution that may be required between Projects, Technical, or Business teams. The OSC remains available to consult upon the validity of technical contracts managed by the Technical Steering Committee. The remaining Committees, Intersect Staff, and the Community are encouraged to reach the OSC at any time for clarity on any open source topic.&#x20;

### Mission

Intersect’s Open Source Committee fosters the development and evolution of Cardano as a community-led, decentralized open-source project. Our mission is to support the growth of Cardano through community-driven decision-making. We are committed to providing tools, policies, and guidance to ensure its success, adaptability, and accessibility.

### Vision

The Open Source Committee envisions a future where the Cardano Open Source Project (COSP) is strongly led by a thriving and diverse community, with its development process free from dominance by any single entity.

We foresee a future where the project is known for both its technological excellence and its democratic, inclusive development process. Cardano will exemplify a decentralized and stable ecosystem where every contributor plays its part.&#x20;

### OSC responsibilities:

* Manage and oversee the allocation and use of OSC Budget&#x20;
* Provide strategic direction and input on Intersect's open-source initiatives and policies
* Review and approve the OSO Annual Roadmap
* Manage and lead various working groups
* Evaluate the output of working groups and the OSO
* Oversee OSO Project Support Services, such as project selection and vendor review&#x20;
* Conduct annual performance reviews for OSO Personnel

### OSC Core Values

#### Open:&#x20;

_Maintain the openness of the COSP_

The OSC encourages the open, canonical, and trusted standing of the COSP within the community.&#x20;

This is important because COSP is more than a collection of open source GitHub repositories; it represents the source code for the binaries deployed onto the Cardano mainnet, via the Haskell node.

\


#### Sustainable:

_Ensure the continued development of the COSP._

The OSC is dedicated to fostering the long-term growth, stability, and ecological integrity of the Cardano blockchain. Our mission is to ensure that Cardano’s development adheres to principles of integrity, openness, quality, and community.&#x20;

Through strategic planning, stakeholder engagement, and rigorous evaluation, the OSC is committed to making Cardano a model for sustainable blockchain innovation.

#### Quality:&#x20;

_Promote the security and health of the Cardano mainnet._&#x20;

\
The OSC ensures that open source policies guide contributions to be at the highest quality possible by closely monitoring improvements and new directions in open source development.&#x20;

This is important because new or revised practices can and will be included in future adaptations of the Governance policy ensuring the quality of Cardano’s development remains efficient and above reproach.&#x20;

#### Citizenship:&#x20;

_Foster good Open Source citizens._

The OSC creates an open and clear path for contributors in the COSP, including a Contribution Ladder, a Project Incubation strategy, and methods to address low hanging fruit such as how to file an Issue, make Pull Requests, and much more.

This is important because we want the COSP to adopt a revolutionary model in the open-source world, in which contributors take the time to contribute to the broader ecosystem.
