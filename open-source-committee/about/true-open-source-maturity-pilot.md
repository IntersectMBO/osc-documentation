# 😉 True Open Source Maturity Pilot

## **Report Contents:**

This report serves as a baseline for a situation analysis aimed at evaluating and marking key areas for improvement within the Cardano open-source ecosystem. The analysis was conducted through a series of situation use cases, each assessed with a simple pass or fail metric. These assessments provide a comprehensive overview of Cardano's open-source performance on a 14-point scale.\

<summary>Key Notes:</summary>

*   This assessment was conducted using maintainers that have no direct connection to founding entities of Cardano to truly test community maintainer contribution processes.\


    The following repos were assessed based on having non-founding entity maintainers currently:&#x20;

    1. Cardano Addresses: Drip Dropz
    2. Cardano CLI: Tweag
    3. Ouroboros Consensus: Tweag\


</details>

**General Observations:**

* This process has established a baseline for Cardano to improve its open-source practice and be rated by the community it is trying to foster whether it is truly open source or not.
* Although Cardano passed, there is much more room for improvement and the assessment can be refined further for stronger evaluations.

<details>

<summary>Assessment Method:</summary>

1. Each maintainer is asked a series of questions about their experience based on the 14 point criteria listed above.
2. These questions are collected into a google form, which transponders to a google sheet which then evaluates the criteria.
3. The answers are graded to specific criteria which is listed in the Measurement Criteria section listed in each below category.
4. The overall answers are then graded on sum average to determine a cumulative score.
5. The cumulative score is weighed against a 50% Pass / Fail grade for each category.
6. After each tally is collated, the sums are averaged overall into a general summary grade for all repos evaluated.
   1. Multiple responses for 1 repository are averaged out to be 1 submission into the higher level evaluation.
7. A Pass Rate is also calculated and posted against a letter grade to officially rate the open source practice.
