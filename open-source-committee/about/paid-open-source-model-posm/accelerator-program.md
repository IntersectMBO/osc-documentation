# ü§Ø Accelerator Program

### Executive Summary

The POSM Accelerator Program is a structured, mentor-led initiative designed to help open-source Cardano projects evolve from early-stage ideas into sustainable, investable ventures. It combines three specialized workshop circuits that can operate independently or sequentially as a full acceleration path:

1. [COSS for Cardano](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDcCEwszHQyc7UQtSv2Mk_YNKQHuRubxHYQZizKpY_c/edit?usp=sharing) ‚Äì teaches how to turn open-source projects into sustainable Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) businesses.
2. [Investor Pitching & Fundraising](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bFLTSxrdaJIsYGNF9CrRpQf1N0kft8hl005mYo2P6GU/edit?usp=sharing) ‚Äì prepares founders to effectively present their ideas to investors, funds, and ecosystem programs.
3. [Technical/Product Review & Market Fit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sAByO44UTEDZ2aS9DGdRg7Zb8weks_kH5vKDuYI53Yk/edit?usp=sharing) ‚Äì validates technical integrity, user alignment, and market readiness before scaling.

Each circuit runs as a five-session series (1 hour per week over one month) and is guided by mentors with deep expertise in blockchain, open source, and venture acceleration. The program produces tangible outputs ‚Äî including validated business models, investor-ready decks, and market-aligned product roadmaps ‚Äî and establishes a reusable library of tools, templates, and recordings for future cohorts.

### Program Purpose

The Accelerator Program strengthens Cardano‚Äôs open-source ecosystem by professionalizing how builders develop, validate, and scale their projects. While treasury and grant mechanisms provide essential funding, long-term sustainability requires education, discipline, and market understanding.

Through POSM, Intersect provides the structure and mentorship to bridge technical innovation with real-world execution. This program helps teams move from grant dependency to commercial readiness, from idea to product-market fit, and from code to capital.
