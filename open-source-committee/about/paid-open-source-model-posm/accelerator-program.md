# ðŸ¤¯ Accelerator Program

Mission:

To empower and accelerate high-potential projects within the Cardano ecosystem by offering tailored support, strategic guidance, and essential resources through the Commercialization Working Group.&#x20;

This accelerator initiative aims to bridge the gap between open-source innovation and market adoption (from start-ups to Fortune 1000 companies), ensuring projects have the tools to scale, deliver tangible value, and contribute to the sustainable commercial growth of the Cardano ecosystem.

\
Scope of Work:

The Accelerator Research Program will focus on three key stages of project development to support teams from ideation through market launch:

1. Pre-Catalyst Proposal Training:
2. Equip early-stage projects with skills to develop strong, fundable proposals.
3. Focus on technical feasibility, value proposition, and market positioning.
4. Post-Catalyst Business Model Mentoring:
5. Provide structured guidance to funded projects on refining their business models, enhancing go-to-market strategies, and ensuring long-term sustainability.
6. Emphasis on revenue generation pathways and scalability.
7. Product Viability & Performance (PVP) Accelerator:
8. Develop a pilot program to prepare projects for commercialization readiness, including product validation, market fit analysis, and investor preparation.
9. Research and document best practices for running accelerators within Cardano and analyze models from similar ecosystems.

#### Program Objectives:

* Support Market Readiness:\
  Prepare projects with the resources and mentorship needed to move from development to a market-ready state.
* Drive Ecosystem Adoption:\
  Enable projects to achieve real-world adoption within the Cardano ecosystem and the broader blockchain space.
* Enhance Commercial Viability:\
  Guide projects in refining their business models, establishing go-to-market strategies, and identifying revenue opportunities.
* Foster Strategic Partnerships:\
  Connect accelerator participants with industry partners, investors, and ecosystem collaborators to drive growth and adoption.
* Work with [Project Catalyst Accelerators:\
  ](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/cardano-partners-growth-and-acceleration)Help to provide mentors to Project Catalyst funded accelerators such as Techstars, Draper, United Nations Development Program w/ Emurgo and CV Labs .&#x20;
* Ensure Sustainable Growth:\
  Support the development of scalable solutions aligned with Cardanoâ€™s long-term ecosystem vision.
* Monitor & Measure Impact:\
  Define and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess project progress, ensuring they meet milestones and deliver measurable value.

#### Program Structure & Staffing:

* Staffing Needs:
  * Senior Business Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): To provide strategic mentoring and domain expertise.
  * Business Architects: To guide projects in designing scalable and sustainable models.
  * Mentors & Judges: To assess project potential, offer feedback, and evaluate progress during accelerator stages.
  * "Sharks": For mock pitch sessions and funding simulations, helping teams prepare for real investor scenarios.
* Framework:
  * Design and implement training pilots for each program area:
  * Pre-Catalyst Proposal Training
  * Post-Catalyst Business Model Mentoring
  * PVP Accelerator or preparation for external funding arenas
* Filtering Process:
  * Develop a selection framework to identify high-potential projects, with possible focus on specific market categories to align with Cardanoâ€™s strategic goals.

#### Connection to Other Programs:

This accelerator will integrate with existing Cardano programs and funding mechanisms, such as Project Catalyst and the Commercialization Working Group, ensuring continuity and maximizing the impact of funded projects. The accelerator will also provide insights for refining future programs and creating stronger pathways for ecosystem growth.

Connect to other Accelerators/Incubators to understand what works or is needed to have a successful project run. Connect Cardano Developers/Mentors to other Accelerators where we are projects that touch Cardano Ecosystem are active.

#### Budget Request:

* Amount Requested: $50,000 USD
* Allocation:
  * Fund three (2-3 week) pilot programs, covering each accelerator stage
    * Each pilot program would have 5-10 startups.
  * Support staffing, materials, mentorship costs, and participant stipends.
  * Conduct research and deliver an analysis document for the PVP Accelerator, outlining a scalable accelerator framework and best practices.
  * Framework for Accelerator SaaS - off-shelf white label service ( to be integrated into Intersect web domain) - reduced cost of running the accelerator and need for permanent staff [(The Secret - Demo Video](https://www.loom.com/share/95594ed7239a473a910f0a041f973a4c?sid=7dda70e6-657d-4d78-973a-09f3a0bebb0d) - 4 mins ;[ Costs 1K USD/year](https://www.joinsecret.com/business) - website
