# Code For Us

### Executive Summary

Code for Us Program operates as a bounty-based funding mechanism enabling approved projects to request funding for specific feature development. It incentivizes developers by compensating them directly upon successful delivery, enhancing ecosystem tooling and innovation.

### Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria are structured into two categories: projects requesting features, and developers fulfilling bounties.

Projects Requesting Feature Funding:

* Must be an open-source repository within the Cardano ecosystem.
* Clearly aligned with ecosystem priorities and demonstrating active usage.
* The proposed feature must be well-defined, practical, and provide evident value to Cardano developers or end-users.
* Requires explicit approval from both the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and the Open Source Committee (OSC) to ensure strategic alignment and technical feasibility.
* Projects do not need to be Intersect-incubated but gain additional advantages if they are.

Developers Fulfilling Bounties:

* Must be verified contributors within the Cardano ecosystem, having a demonstrable contribution history.
* Required to have relevant technical expertise to successfully deliver the requested feature.
* Commit to completing the feature within clearly defined timeframes and meeting established acceptance criteria.
* Adhere strictly to open-source contribution best practices, including clear documentation, rigorous testing, and community engagement.

### Project Qualification Criteria

For a project to qualify for Code for Us funding, it must satisfy:

* Open-Source Repository Status:\
  Publicly accessible repository, licensed under a recognized open-source license.
* Feature Development Justification:\
  Clearly articulated feature requests must include a defined problem statement, expected outcome, and measurable success criteria demonstrating direct ecosystem benefit.
* Project Lifecycle & Activity Level:\
  Projects must fall within Incubation, Growth, or Maturity stages according to the Project Lifecycle Framework. Repositories with extended inactivity (over six months) require additional justification for inclusion. Not mandatory.
* Commitment to Feature Implementation & Maintenance:\
  Project maintainers must guarantee integration and ongoing maintenance of funded features. Removal or abandonment of funded features requires explicit approval from TSC & OSC.
* Approval from TSC & OSC:\
  All feature requests are rigorously reviewed by both committees, evaluating their technical viability, strategic fit, sustainability, and potential ecosystem impact.

### Funding Structure & Resource Allocation

Funding through Code for Us operates through a bounty-driven workflow:

1. Project Approval:\
   Projects are vetted and approved for participation based on alignment with ecosystem needs and project qualification criteria.
2. Feature Bounty Creation:\
   Approved projects propose specific features. The TSC & OSC evaluate, prioritize, and allocate funding pools to these features.
3. Developer Selection & Work Fulfillment:\
   Developers submit bids for open bounties, outlining their qualifications and timelines. Accepted developers then implement features following clearly defined specifications.
4. Payment Upon Feature Acceptance:\
   Once submitted features pass rigorous technical and functional evaluations, developers receive their allocated bounty payment.

Oversight & Governance:

* TSC: Ensures alignment with Cardano’s technical roadmap, prevents redundant or unnecessary developments.
* OSC: Validates open-source governance compliance, code quality, and security standards.

### &#x20;Review & Evaluation Process

Evaluation follows a structured, feature-driven cycle:

1. Feature Request Approval:\
   Project feature requests undergo review by TSC & OSC, prioritizing feasibility and strategic ecosystem alignment.
2. Developer Selection & Implementation:\
   Approved features listed publicly as open bounties. Developers selected based on technical skill, experience, and bid proposal quality.
3. Feature Submission & Testing:\
   Developers submit completed features for thorough technical and functional reviews, including security audits and usability tests.
4. Post-Integration Quality Check:\
   A subsequent 30-day evaluation allows community testing and feedback. Critical issues must be resolved promptly by the developer for final acceptance.

Ensuring Quality & Compliance:

* Features undergo rigorous security audits, ensuring no vulnerabilities.
* Extensive usability and integration testing verify functionality and user satisfaction.
* Code must strictly adhere to Cardano’s coding standards, open-source best practices, and comprehensive documentation requirements.

### Performance Metrics & Responsibilities

Developers completing Code for Us bounties must meet explicit benchmarks:

* Feature Completeness:\
  Must fully and accurately deliver the requested feature within agreed scope and timeframe.
* Security Compliance:\
  Delivered features must not introduce vulnerabilities. Security audits must pass without unresolved findings.
* Code Quality & Adherence to Best Practices:\
  Code quality assessments via linting and maintainability reviews are mandatory. Strict adherence to established ecosystem coding standards is required.
* Testing & Stability:\
  Features must pass thorough unit tests, integration tests, and real-user testing scenarios before acceptance.
* Documentation & Developer Support:\
  Comprehensive documentation for installation, usage, and developer instructions must accompany feature submissions.

Failure to meet these expectations results in revision requests or potential reassignment of the bounty.

### Appeals & Reapplication Process

The program includes structured mechanisms for fairness and continuous improvement:

* Appeals for Rejected Feature Submissions:\
  Developers can appeal within 7 days of rejection. They must clearly address required corrections, documentation improvements, or justify implementation choices.
* Developer Reapplication After Multiple Rejections:\
  Developers facing repeated rejections must wait three months before reapplying. During this period, they should engage with non-funded contributions or undertake mentorship programs to demonstrate improvement.
* Persistent inability to meet quality standards may result in permanent exclusion from bounty participation.

### Governance & Decision-Making

Code for Us governance is collaborative:

* Technical Steering Committee (TSC):\
  Reviews technical viability, prioritizes feature alignment with Cardano’s roadmap, and validates technical quality.
* Open Source Committee (OSC):\
  Ensures compliance with open-source governance, code licensing standards, community engagement, and sustainability criteria.
* Joint Decision-Making Process:\
  Both committees collaborate closely to achieve consensus on approvals, funding allocations, performance reviews, appeals, and reapplication processes.
