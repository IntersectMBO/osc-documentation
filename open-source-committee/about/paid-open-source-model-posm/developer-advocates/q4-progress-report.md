{% file src="../../../.gitbook/assets/DA Q4 Progress Report Rev. 1pdf.pdf" %}

The **Q4 2025 Developer Advocate Progress Report** documents the delivery of contract-defined milestones by Intersect’s four Developer Advocates across the final quarter of 2025. The report provides a structured, milestone-by-milestone record of activity, outcomes, and qualitative impact across developer experience, onboarding, documentation, community engagement, innovation, diversity & inclusion, and strategic collaboration.

Across the quarter, a total of **38 deliverables** were tracked, spanning both individual and collaborative commitments. Collectively, the Advocates demonstrated consistent execution across all eleven contractual milestones, with particular strength in onboarding new developers, sustaining Developer Experience Working Group operations, and expanding regional community engagement in Africa and Francophone developer communities.

Key outcomes:

* **Sustained Developer Experience Operations:** Regular leadership and facilitation of the Developer Experience Working Group across multiple time zones, with documented session planning, educational delivery, and ongoing tracking of developer pain points.
* **Meaningful Onboarding Impact:** Direct onboarding of more than a dozen new developers through GitHub contributions, 1:1 technical mentoring, and structured community sessions, exceeding minimum contractual expectations in several cases.
* **Strong Community and Regional Engagement:** Delivery of in-person and hybrid events in Kenya, Nigeria, Zambia, Mauritius, and Francophone regions, reaching hundreds of participants across meetups, workshops, and contributor onboarding sessions.
* **Ecosystem Growth and Strategic Partnerships:** Initiation of formal collaborations with three major academic and innovation institutions in Kenya, establishing a foundation for sustained ecosystem partnerships in 2026.
* **Ecosystem Visibility and Innovation:** Production of “New Projects on Cardano” spotlights featuring Empowa and DeltaDeFi, and delivery of technical showcases on node operations and smart contract patterns.

In addition to activity delivery, the Advocates jointly contributed to the **revision of the State of Developer Experience Survey**, strengthened documentation in the developer-experience repository, and laid groundwork for deeper integration with Core Cardano teams in the next quarter.

Overall, Q4 2025 reflects **full execution across all contract-defined milestones**, with several areas of over-performance. The report provides a transparent, auditable record suitable for community review and committee oversight, and establishes a strong operational baseline for 2026 program expansion.
