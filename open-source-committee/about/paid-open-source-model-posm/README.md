# Paid Open Source Model (POSM)

The Paid Open Source Model is now from concept into a practice as we pilot this whitepaper idea into a thriving example of Web3 Sustainability to address the core problems found in most open-source ecosystems. This work started out as a YouTube presentation, gone to whitepaper to a budget line item in the Cardano treasury funding process and is now live after community approval from DReps and Constitutional Committee.

For full details on this program and it's history, please see the below resources:
