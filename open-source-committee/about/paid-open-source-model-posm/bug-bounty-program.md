# ðŸ«¢ Bug Bounty Program

#### Executive Summary

The Bug Bounty Program is designed to enhance the security of the ecosystem by incentivizing ethical hackers and security researchers to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. With a $300,000 budget for year 1, the program provides structured rewards based on severity and impact, ensuring proactive security measures while maintaining transparency and accountability.

The program operates under a three-tier governance model:

* Security Council â€“ Handles incident management, vulnerability validation, and remediation efforts.
* Open Source Committee â€“ Serves as a review-only body, providing oversight without execution authority, but validates the payment allocation.
* Open Source Office â€“ Manages program execution, rewards distribution, and compliance.

#### Key Features of the Bug Bounty Program:

* Structured reward tiers: Payments range from $20,000 to $1,000 based on severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
* Clear reporting process: Researchers must provide detailed reports with proof of concept for validation.
* Responsible disclosure policy: Participants must follow strict guidelines to ensure ethical vulnerability reporting.
* Rapid response timelines: The Security Council will validate reports within 7-14 days and deploy fixes based on severity.
* Transparent reward distribution: Payments are processed within 30 days of validation, with multiple payout options (ADA, USDC, or fiat).
* Continuous improvement: Regular program audits, budget optimizations, and community engagement initiatives will ensure long-term success.

By implementing this structured and well-governed bug bounty program, the ecosystem strengthens its security resilience, fosters community participation, and upholds ethical vulnerability management practices.

### 1. Program Scope and Coverage

This section defines the boundaries of the bug bounty program, specifying which systems are eligible for testing and which activities are prohibited to ensure ethical participation.

#### 1.1 Systems and Assets in Scope

The bug bounty program applies to critical infrastructure and software components that are essential to the security and stability of the ecosystem.

**Eligible Targets:**

* Theoretical attacks without proof of exploitability.
* Bugs that require extensive user cooperation (e.g., social engineering-based exploits).

### 2.0 Vulnerability Classification and Reward Structure

This section defines how vulnerabilities are categorized, how reward amounts are determined, and how funds are managed to ensure the sustainability of the program.

#### 2.1 Classification Criteria (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

All reported vulnerabilities are categorized based on impact and exploitability, using the following severity levels:&#x20;

CVSS is utilized to measure impact scoring: [https://www.first.org/cvss/](https://www.first.org/cvss/)

| Severity Level | Description                                                                               | Example Scenarios                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical       | Exploitable vulnerabilities that compromise funds, user data, or system control.          | Remote code execution, wallet private key leakage, full account takeover. |
| High           | Issues that lead to significant security breaches, requiring minimal user interaction.    | Authentication bypass, API abuse allowing unauthorized transactions.      |
| Medium         | Security flaws that require additional attack vectors to be exploited.                    | Information disclosure, improper access control, minor logic bugs.        |
| Low            | Issues that do not pose immediate security risks but could contribute to larger exploits. | Minor UI flaws affecting security, error messages revealing stack traces. |

#### 2.2 Reward Tiers and Payouts

Each severity level has a corresponding reward range, ensuring fair compensation based on impact. These ranges serve as a guidance and does wholly reflect an award, as each issue or big incident may justify a higher bounty depending on level of threat.

| Severity Level | Anticipated Reward Range |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Critical       | $10,000 - $20,000        |
| High           | $5,000 - $10,000         |
| Medium         | $1,000 - $5,000          |
| Low            | Up to $1,000             |

**Factors Affecting Payout Amounts:**

* Quality of report: Clear documentation, proof of concept (PoC), and exploitability details.
* Reproducibility: Whether the vulnerability can be consistently replicated.
* Severity and impact: Higher impact vulnerabilities receive higher payouts.
* Novelty: Whether the vulnerability is previously unknown or a duplicate report.

#### 2.3 Reward Pool Distribution and Adjustments

To maintain the programâ€™s longevity, funds are allocated strategically throughout the program duration.

**Budget Allocation Strategy:**

* $300,000 total pool for year 1, distributed based on reported vulnerabilities.
* Quarterly evaluations to assess program engagement and adjust payouts if needed.
* Emergency reserve allocation for handling high-impact security incidents.
* Roll-over funds policy â€“ Unused funds can be shifted to subsequent program periods or returned to the treasury as overall budgetary policy dictates.

### 3.0 Reporting and Validation Process

This section outlines how security researchers should report vulnerabilities, the steps for validation, and the expected response times from the Security Council.

#### 3.1 Vulnerability Submission Guidelines

All vulnerability reports must be submitted through the GitHub private disclosure process ([https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities?learn=security\_advisories\&learnproduct=code-security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities?learn=security_advisories\&learnproduct=code-security)), which ensures secure communication and proper tracking of submissions.

**Required Information for a Valid Submission:**

A report must include the following details:

1. Title â€“ A concise name for the vulnerability.
2. Description â€“ A clear explanation of the security issue and its impact.
3. Steps to Reproduce â€“ A detailed, step-by-step guide demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
4. Proof of Concept (PoC) â€“ A working example showing exploitability (e.g., scripts, screenshots, or video walkthroughs).
5. Affected Component â€“ Specify which system, smart contract, API, or software is vulnerable.
6. Suggested Remediation â€“ If possible, provide recommendations on how to fix the issue.

**Submission Restrictions:**

* Reports must be original and unpublished at the time of submission.
* Researchers must not publicly disclose the vulnerability before the issue is patched.
* Automated scanning or brute-force techniques that degrade system performance are prohibited.

#### 3.2 Validation and Prioritization

Once a vulnerability is submitted, it goes through the Security Councilâ€™s validation process to confirm its authenticity and impact.

**Validation Steps:**

1. Acknowledgment â€“ Initial confirmation of submission within 24 hours.
2. Triage and Reproduction â€“ The Security Council attempts to reproduce the issue within 3-7 days, depending on complexity.
3. Severity Classification â€“ The issue is categorized based on impact (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
4. Fix Deployment Planning â€“ The Security Council coordinates with developers to determine a remediation timeline.
5. Researcher Notification â€“ The submitter is informed of classification and next steps.

**Duplicate Reports Policy:**

* If multiple researchers submit the same vulnerability, only the first valid report will be rewarded.
* If a similar report adds significant new details, it may receive partial recognition.

#### 3.3 Communication and Response Times

To maintain transparency and efficiency, the following response timelines are enforced:

| Action                               | Response Time                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledgment of submission         | Within 24 hours                                      |
| Validation & severity classification | Within 7-14 days                                     |
| Fix deployment timeline              | Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days, Medium/Low: 30 days |
| Final researcher notification        | Within 30 days of fix deployment                     |
| Reward payout processing             | Within 30 days of validation                         |

**Security Council Escalations:**

If a vulnerability presents an immediate, system-wide risk, the Security Council will escalate the issue immediately, bypassing standard timelines for an emergency response.

### 4.0 Governance and Oversight

The Bug Bounty Program operates under a structured governance model that ensures accountability, transparency, and efficient execution. The governance structure consists of three key entities:

1. Security Council â€“ Handles all incident management and response activities.
2. Open Source Committee â€“ A review-only body providing oversight without execution authority.
