# 🥲 Cardano Summer of Code

**Decision on Cardano Summer of Code Program**\
Following the Open Source Committee (OSC) meeting on November 6, 2025, the committee has decided not to proceed with the Cardano Summer of Code program. This determination was based on several key factors:

* Resource Constraints: Limited availability of personnel and support to manage the initiative effectively.
* Scope of Work: The program's requirements exceeded current capacity and could jeopardize quality.
* Success Criteria: Established benchmarks for program viability and impact, present a barrier too high for success.

While this program will not move forward in the immediate term, it may be revisited as a potential budget proposal for 2026.

**Focus on Existing Programs**\
With nine other active programs currently underway, the OSC prioritizes the effective implementation of initiatives under the Paid Open Source Model (POSM). This strategic focus ensures sustained progress in core areas without overextension.

**Fund Reallocation**\
All allocated funds for the Cardano Summer of Code—totaling 400,000 ADA—will be returned to the treasury. This process will be handled by the administrator (Intersect) in the near future.\
\
**Impact on Open Source Sustainability**\
As the Cardano Summer of Code was positioned as a peripheral element within the POSM framework, its deferral will not affect the primary open source sustainability activities. Core efforts remain on track and unhindered.\
