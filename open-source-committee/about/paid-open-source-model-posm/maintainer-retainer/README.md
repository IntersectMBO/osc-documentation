## Executive Summary

Maintainer Retainer Program provides recurring funding to experienced contributors responsible for maintaining critical Cardano open-source repositories, ensuring projects remain secure, regularly updated, and actively developed.

## Definitions

**Core Maintainer**\
Senior project steward with final technical authority over a repo’s direction. Owns strategic decisions, governance/policy work, release sign-off, and security-sensitive changes; mentors others and ensures long-term project health.

**Community Maintainer**\
A Community Maintainer is identified as a Trusted Committer in any ‘like’ project, and via application is selected to participate in the Maintainer Retainer program to expand capacity around a project (including technical, documentation, community, or ecosystem-advocacy work—not limited to coding). Focuses on day-to-day maintenance, user-feedback loops, and community operations that increase quality and throughput; without holding ultimate decision rights or high-risk credentials. Must meet the Contribution Ladder threshold (≥ Trusted Committer) across code, docs, governance, or ecosystem advocacy, and pass the program’s 30-day evaluation before ongoing funding.\

## How they differ (at a glance)

| Dimension                    | Core Maintainer                                                                                                                                | Community Maintainer                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary mandate              | Set strategy, make final technical/governance calls, ensure release quality and sustainability.                                                | Execute and scale day-to-day maintenance; triage, review, test, document, and surface ecosystem/user feedback and usage patterns to keep velocity and relevance high (not limited to coding).             |
| Authority & decision rights  | Final say on architecture, roadmap alignment, releases, and policy within project governance.                                                  | Recommend and implement; proposes changes and participates in reviews, but defers final calls to Core Maintainers/PMC.                                                                                    |
| Access level                 | May hold elevated repo permissions and release responsibilities; at least one Maintainer should be an approved “Insider” for security matters. | Standard write/maintain permissions; no admin/secrets or signing keys by default; can be added as “Insider” only if vetted per security policy.                                                           |
| Security-sensitive work      | Leads/co-leads on embargoed fixes and coordinated releases.                                                                                    | Assists under direction (repro, tests, docs, backports); escalates promptly; Insider status if/when approved.                                                                                             |
| Release responsibilities     | Owns release criteria and final sign-off.                                                                                                      | Preps changelogs, verifies checks, tags low-risk backports as delegated; channels user-impact notes from the field.                                                                                       |
| Program eligibility & review | Typically already at top of ladder; subject to governance expectations.                                                                        | Must be ≥ Trusted Committer and complete 30-day trial; then quarterly/annual performance reviews for continued funding; eligibility includes code, docs, governance, or ecosystem advocacy contributions. |

## How Community Maintainers assist Core Maintainers

* **Triage & backlog hygiene (as permitted):** label/route issues, reproduce bugs, close stale items, maintain the project board.
* **Code quality pipeline (as permitted and when requested):** review routine PRs, enforce contribution standards, add tests, handle dependency and CI updates—but only where a project has identified a genuine need for extra engineering support.
* **Docs, user feedback & comms (as permitted):** keep READMEs/guides current, draft release notes, respond to contributor queries, mentor newcomers, and act as power users who surface pain points, highlight usage patterns, and assess feature impacts across the ecosystem. These contributions may be entirely non-code but are equally critical to project health.
* **Security support (as permitted):** assist responders with reproductions, testing, and backports under Insider controls when approved.

### Governance & compliance responsibilities (Community Maintainers)

* **Institute project governance:** help operationalize the project’s agreed governance model (roles, decision processes, voting/consensus rules), and keep MAINTAINERS.md / CODEOWNERS current.
* **OSC policy compliance:** ensure the repository meets Intersect’s Open Source Committee (OSC) policy requirements (licensing, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, release and change-control procedures, code of conduct, DCO/CLA as applicable).
* **Checklists and attestations:** maintain and regularly update compliance checklists; prepare evidence for periodic OSC reviews and audits; flag gaps and propose remediations.
* **Process stewardship:** facilitate issue/PR templates, labeling policies, and RFC/CIP-style proposal flows where applicable; coordinate governance ceremonies (e.g., release readiness, roadmap checkpoints).
* **Risk and quality gates:** verify that pre-merge and pre-release gates (tests, SBOMs, vulnerability scans, dependency policies) are applied and documented; escalate exceptions to Core Maintainers for final determination.

> Program note: Maintainer Retainer requires at least Trusted Committer level and includes a 30-day evaluation plus recurring performance reviews—this is the default gate for Community Maintainers entering the role. Importantly, contributions may take different forms depending on project needs: coding, documentation, governance, or ecosystem advocacy.

### Eligibility Criteria

To qualify, maintainers must:

* Be active contributors to eligible Cardano open-source repositories.
* Have achieved at least Trusted Committer Level according to the Contribution Ladder Framework.
* Consistently contribute in areas such as code commits, issue resolution, documentation, governance, or ecosystem/user advocacy (e.g., identifying pain points, usage patterns, and assessing feature impact).
* Maintain projects in one of the Incubation, Growth, or Maturity stages per the Project Lifecycle Framework.
* Pass an initial 30-day evaluation period, demonstrating role-appropriate capability (technical, documentation, governance, or ecosystem advocacy), responsiveness, and community engagement.
* Commit to following best practices, including open-source governance standards, repository security, documentation accuracy, and community mentoring.

### Project Qualification Criteria

For a project to qualify:

* It must be categorized at the Incubation, Growth, or Maturity stage.
* It must provide critical infrastructure, foundational technology, or developer tooling for the Cardano ecosystem.
* Demonstrate active and significant usage within the Cardano community (developers, dApps, operators/power users, and other ecosystem stakeholders).
* Maintain clear governance procedures, an active roadmap, structured issue resolution processes, and up-to-date documentation with established user-feedback channels (e.g., pain-point intake, usage pattern tracking) to inform priorities.
* Obtain formal approval from both the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and the Open Source Committee (OSC).

### Funding Structure & Resource Allocation

The Maintainer Retainer Program provides recurring, ongoing financial support to approved maintainers. Funding allocation is executed through the following process:

1. Project Approval:\
   Reviewed and approved by TSC & OSC based on eligibility and project criteria.
2. Maintainer Selection:\
   Maintainers must meet Contribution Ladder requirements and successfully complete an initial 30-day evaluation.
3. Funding Disbursement:\
   Funding is provided on a recurring schedule contingent upon successful quarterly and annual performance reviews.
4. Performance-based Renewals:\
   Continuation of funding depends on maintainers consistently meeting established benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

#### Oversight & Governance:

* Technical Steering Committee (TSC) ensures funding aligns with Cardano’s core infrastructure and technical priorities.
* Open Source Committee (OSC) oversees adherence to open-source best practices, licensing, and security compliance.

### Review & Evaluation Process

The Maintainer Retainer evaluation process is structured as follows:

* Initial 30-Day Evaluation Period:
  * New maintainers must demonstrate contributions, community engagement, and adherence to governance and best practices. A self-assessment report is required at the end of this period.
* Quarterly Performance Reviews:\
  Evaluations every three months include:
* Contributions (commits, PR reviews)
* Security and stability practices
* Community engagement and mentorship
* Documentation quality
  * Consecutive failures result in warnings and potential funding suspension.
* Annual Renewal Review:
  * A comprehensive annual assessment of the maintainer’s effectiveness, continued relevance, and potential succession planning. Results dictate continued funding or reassignment/removal from the program.

### Performance Metrics & Responsibilities

Maintainers must meet strict performance benchmarks, including:

* Regular Code Contributions:\
  Active updates, enhancements, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
* Security & Stability Maintenance:\
  Timely application of security patches, dependency updates, and maintaining zero unresolved critical vulnerabilities.
* Community Engagement:\
  Active support for contributors, responsiveness to community inquiries, mentoring new contributors, and promoting a healthy open-source culture.
* Documentation Quality:\
  Keeping accurate, clear, and accessible documentation (README files, APIs, developer guides).
* Alignment with Roadmap:\
  Activities must clearly support Cardano's long-term technical and infrastructure goals.

### Evaluation Methods Include:

* Commit history reviews
* Issue resolution tracking (via GitHub/GitLab)
* Security audits and dependency checks
* Community interaction logs and feedback
* Documentation reviews

Failure to meet expectations triggers performance warnings, followed potentially by removal from the program.

### Appeals & Reapplication Process

Maintainers facing negative evaluations have structured options:

* Appealing Negative Reviews:
  * Maintainers can appeal within 14 days, providing justifications and evidence of overlooked contributions. Appeals result in either probationary periods or denial of funding.
* Reapplication after Removal:
  * Maintainers removed due to performance may reapply after six months, demonstrating:
* Renewed open-source contributions
* Improved community engagement
* Updated adherence to maintenance best practices
  * Reapplications require endorsement from current maintainers or committee members.

### Governance & Decision-Making

Maintainer Retainer Program governance involves:

* Technical Steering Committee (TSC):
  * Ensures alignment with Cardano's technical roadmap, infrastructure, and security standards. Reviews technical contributions, project approvals, and feature alignment.
* Open Source Committee (OSC):
  * Oversees open-source compliance, community engagement, sustainability, and licensing/security governance.
* Collaborative Decision-Making:
  * Both TSC and OSC must agree on all approvals, reviews, funding renewals, and program terminations. In disputes, joint sessions are held to reach consensus.
