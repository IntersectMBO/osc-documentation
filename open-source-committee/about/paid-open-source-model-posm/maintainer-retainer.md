# Maintainer Retainer

### Executive Summary

Maintainer Retainer Program provides recurring funding to experienced contributors responsible for maintaining critical Cardano open-source repositories, ensuring projects remain secure, regularly updated, and actively developed.

### Eligibility Criteria

To qualify, maintainers must:

* Be active contributors to eligible Cardano open-source repositories.
* Have achieved at least Trusted Committer Level according to the Contribution Ladder Framework.
* Consistently contribute in areas like code commits, issue resolution, documentation, or governance.
* Maintain projects in one of the Incubation, Growth, or Maturity stages per the Project Lifecycle Framework.
* Pass an initial 30-day evaluation period, demonstrating technical capability, responsiveness, and community engagement.
* Commit to following best practices, including open-source governance standards, repository security, documentation accuracy, and community mentoring.

### Project Qualification Criteria

For a project to qualify:

* It must be categorized at the Incubation, Growth, or Maturity stage.
* It must provide critical infrastructure, foundational technology, or developer tooling for the Cardano ecosystem.
* Demonstrate active and significant usage within the Cardano community (developers, dApps).
* Maintain clear governance procedures, an active roadmap, structured issue resolution processes, and up-to-date documentation.
* Obtain formal approval from both the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and the Open Source Committee (OSC).\


### Funding Structure & Resource Allocation

The Maintainer Retainer Program provides recurring, ongoing financial support to approved maintainers. Funding allocation is executed through the following process:

1. Project Approval:\
   Reviewed and approved by TSC & OSC based on eligibility and project criteria.
2. Maintainer Selection:\
   Maintainers must meet Contribution Ladder requirements and successfully complete an initial 30-day evaluation.
3. Funding Disbursement:\
   Funding is provided on a recurring schedule contingent upon successful quarterly and annual performance reviews.
4. Performance-based Renewals:\
   Continuation of funding depends on maintainers consistently meeting established benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

#### Oversight & Governance:

* Technical Steering Committee (TSC) ensures funding aligns with Cardano’s core infrastructure and technical priorities.
* Open Source Committee (OSC) oversees adherence to open-source best practices, licensing, and security compliance.

### Review & Evaluation Process

The Maintainer Retainer evaluation process is structured as follows:

* Initial 30-Day Evaluation Period:
  * New maintainers must demonstrate contributions, community engagement, and adherence to governance and best practices. A self-assessment report is required at the end of this period.
* Quarterly Performance Reviews:\
  Evaluations every three months include:
* Contributions (commits, PR reviews)
* Security and stability practices
* Community engagement and mentorship
* Documentation quality
  * Consecutive failures result in warnings and potential funding suspension.
* Annual Renewal Review:
  * A comprehensive annual assessment of the maintainer’s effectiveness, continued relevance, and potential succession planning. Results dictate continued funding or reassignment/removal from the program.

### Performance Metrics & Responsibilities

Maintainers must meet strict performance benchmarks, including:

* Regular Code Contributions:\
  Active updates, enhancements, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
* Security & Stability Maintenance:\
  Timely application of security patches, dependency updates, and maintaining zero unresolved critical vulnerabilities.
* Community Engagement:\
  Active support for contributors, responsiveness to community inquiries, mentoring new contributors, and promoting a healthy open-source culture.
* Documentation Quality:\
  Keeping accurate, clear, and accessible documentation (README files, APIs, developer guides).
* Alignment with Roadmap:\
  Activities must clearly support Cardano's long-term technical and infrastructure goals.

### Evaluation Methods Include:

* Commit history reviews
* Issue resolution tracking (via GitHub/GitLab)
* Security audits and dependency checks
* Community interaction logs and feedback
* Documentation reviews

Failure to meet expectations triggers performance warnings, followed potentially by removal from the program.

### Appeals & Reapplication Process

Maintainers facing negative evaluations have structured options:

* Appealing Negative Reviews:
  * Maintainers can appeal within 14 days, providing justifications and evidence of overlooked contributions. Appeals result in either probationary periods or denial of funding.
* Reapplication after Removal:
  * Maintainers removed due to performance may reapply after six months, demonstrating:
* Renewed open-source contributions
* Improved community engagement
* Updated adherence to maintenance best practices
  * Reapplications require endorsement from current maintainers or committee members.

### Governance & Decision-Making

Maintainer Retainer Program governance involves:

* Technical Steering Committee (TSC):
  * Ensures alignment with Cardano's technical roadmap, infrastructure, and security standards. Reviews technical contributions, project approvals, and feature alignment.
* Open Source Committee (OSC):
  * Oversees open-source compliance, community engagement, sustainability, and licensing/security governance.
* Collaborative Decision-Making:
  * Both TSC and OSC must agree on all approvals, reviews, funding renewals, and program terminations. In disputes, joint sessions are held to reach consensus.
