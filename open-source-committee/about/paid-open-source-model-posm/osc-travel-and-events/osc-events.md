### Benefit Report: OSC x Cardano Summit (November 2025)

#### Executive Summary

The Open Source Committee’s in-person attendance at the Cardano Summit in November 2025 delivered clear governance, program, and partnership value. With at least three OSC members present, the committee was able to reinforce institutional relationships, gather high-quality ecosystem intelligence, clarify OSC programs and processes, and initiate a concrete partnership pathway with STORM Partners that is now progressing in alignment with the Accelerator Program.

Both collective outcomes and individual After Action Reports demonstrate that Summit attendance functioned as an extension of the OSC’s governance, stewardship, and program development responsibilities, not merely outreach or representation.

#### Key Committee-Level Benefits

**1. Strengthened Governance Through Direct Ecosystem Intelligence**

Individual member reports consistently show that in-person engagement materially improved the quality of information available to the committee.

* Direct conversations with developers and builders provided grounding for stewardship decisions and surfaced real developer pain points.
* Deep-dive discussions served as a “pulse check” on ecosystem trends, informing alignment of the OSC roadmap with community technical needs.

**2. Improved Clarity of OSC Programs and Governance Processes**

A significant portion of on-site activity focused on clarifying the role, authority, and participation pathways of the OSC and its programs. This reduced process friction, corrected misconceptions, and improved external understanding of OSC governance and program mechanics.

* POSM was positioned as a structured entry point for builders, institutions, and external actors.
* Program advocacy included myth-busting, eligibility clarification, and onboarding guidance for prospective participants.

**3. Tangible Pipeline Development for Programs and Contributors**

These outcomes directly support contributor recruitment, program sourcing, and higher-quality future participation.

* Establishment of 5+ high-lead contributor connections previously hesitant to engage formally with the OSC.
* Identification of gaps between technical readiness and market adoption, informing future POSM and ecosystem support priorities.

**4. Institutional Coordination and Visibility**

Multiple OSC members present enabled coordinated representation and tighter OSC–OSO alignment.

* Active support of OSO programming (e.g., Lunch and Learn) and live bridging of strategy and implementation in Q\&A settings.
* Increased visibility of the OSC’s stewardship role across developers, institutions, and founding entities.

#### Strategic Outcome: STORM Partners Engagement

A major direct outcome of Summit attendance was the initiation of a partnership pathway with STORM Partners:

* Initial conversations began in person at the Summit
* Follow-on discussions are now active post-event
* Current focus is evaluating STORM as a provider for, or partner with, the Accelerator Program

#### Committee Assessment

* Attendance improved the quality of governance inputs
* Reduced misunderstanding of OSC programs and processes
* Created measurable contributor and partner pipelines
* Strengthened OSC–OSO institutional coordination
* Enabled concrete partnership development (STORM)

Summit attendance delivered governance-relevant, program-relevant, and strategically durable outcomes.

#### Outlook

Future attendance by multiple OSC members at major ecosystem events should continue to be part of OSC strategy. The November 2025 Cardano Summit demonstrates that in-person engagement directly translated into institutional, programmatic, and partnership value.
