# Project Support Services

### Request for Project Support: [Support Services Survey](https://forms.clickup.com/9015279944/f/8cnmga8-13635/JABH2WVEOIS8Q4UAGU)

This survey is designed to assist the Open Source Office in determining an appropriate supply timeline and to seek to provide support to as many projects as possible.&#x20;

### Background:&#x20;

In Cardano’s dynamic and rapidly evolving ecosystem, open source projects play a critical role in driving innovation, collaboration, and growth. Yet, managing these projects often comes with significant challenges. Recognizing this, Intersect’s Open Source Office (OSO) is committed to providing essential support services to help teams succeed.

### Definition:&#x20;

As a cornerstone of Cardano’s open source ecosystem, the OSO serves as a central hub of guidance and support. We provide a broad range of resources and expertise to strengthen project management, from navigating licensing requirements to building engaged communities. Our mission is to empower teams to maximize the impact, sustainability, and adoption of their open source contributions.

### Open Source Office (OSO) Support Services

Intersect’s Open Source Office offers a strong foundation of services that address the broader needs of Cardano projects, extending beyond code management and technical decisions. These services are delivered by professional staff who focus on growing the maturity and adoption of Cardano-related open source projects.

We take a **data-driven approach**, actively surveying maintainers and project teams to continuously improve services and measure satisfaction. In addition, we highlight projects and services through platforms such as the Community Spotlight, Essential Cardano, and Cardano 360.

It’s important to note:

* These services are designed to strengthen community stability.
* They do not replace developers or provide full-time resources.
* They are not intended to be in the critical path of project releases.

Instead, our shared services are meant to nurture Cardano projects—supporting incubating and sandbox efforts as they grow into mature, sustainable initiatives.

### Steps to Apply

1. **Complete the Support Services Survey.**
2. **OSO Follow-Up:** A member of the OSO team will review your request and schedule a discovery session if needed.
3. **Matching & Allocation:** We will work to match your needs with our existing provider network. If required, we will open an RFP process. The Open Source Committee (OSC) will make the final allocation decision, after which the support process will begin.
