Intersectâ€™s Open Source (OS) strategy focuses on effective governance, strategic alignment, and community-driven growth to ensure the sustainability and advancement of the Cardano ecosystem. In 2025, this strategy builds on prior initiatives by scaling operations through deeper community engagement, ecosystem expansion, and strategic partnerships, while prioritizing adaptability, inclusivity, and compliance.

Key efforts include refining the **Paid Open Source Model (POSM)** to sustain critical projects, piloting initiatives that enhance ecosystem-wide collaboration, and fostering inclusivity through diversity programs and global community-building.
