# 📊 Cardano’s Decentralized Shift: Key Players and Impact

### The Organizations Behind Cardano (September 2024)

These [reports](cardanos-decentralized-shift-key-players-and-impact.md#reports), completed in September 2024, provides an in-depth analysis of the organizations that have driven the Cardano open-source ecosystem over the past 12 months (from August 2023 to August 2024) in comparison with the previous 12 month period. The report primarily focuses on the contributions from different organizations in Intersect's GitHub repositories (Core Cardano), tracking contributions in terms of code (commits), issues, pull requests (PRs), and comments on issues/PRs. The analysis provides key insights into the evolving role of various organizations within the ecosystem, with a special emphasis on Intersect MBO’s growing influence and the shift in focus from major contributors like Input Output (IOHK).

#### Key Findings:

* **IOHK’s Evolving Role:** Historically, Input Output (IOHK) has been the leading contributor to Cardano’s ecosystem. However, the past year saw a shift in their focus from engineering tasks, such as coding and pull requests, toward more community-focused activities like coordinating issues and fostering collaboration. This shift is a healthy sign for the ecosystem, indicating that IOHK is successfully enabling other organizations to step up and take more leadership roles in development. This transition aligns with the introduction of CIP-1964 in late 2022, which aimed to enhance community participation in the Cardano ecosystem.
* **Intersect MBO’s Growing Influence:** Intersect MBO, established to act as a steward for the Cardano ecosystem, played a key role in diversifying the community of contributors. In the past year, Intersect MBO has significantly ramped up its contributions, particularly in areas like governance tools (e.g., the GovTool project) and other core repositories. This growth demonstrates the success of Intersect MBO in relation to fostering a healthy, multi-organizational open-source community.
* **Top 10 Contributing Organizations:** Over the past year, the top contributors to the Cardano ecosystem, ranked by their activity, were:
  1. Input Output (IOHK): Despite its shift away from direct engineering, IOHK remains the largest contributor by volume, with involvement across all major Cardano repositories.
  2. Tweag: A key contributor to critical repositories such as Ouroboros (consensus and network), Tweag’s contributions have increased dramatically, particularly in code reviews and issue submissions.
  3. Cardano Foundation: The foundation’s contributions grew substantially in the last year, focusing on repositories like cardano-wallet and cardano-node.
  4. Intersect MBO: This organization focused on building the infrastructure of Cardano’s ecosystem, notably in CIPs and governance-related projects.
  5. Quviq: Contributing primarily to formal specifications and the ledger, Quviq’s involvement has increased over the past year.
  6. Well-Typed: After a dip in contributions in 2021, Well-Typed made a strong comeback, contributing extensively to the lsm-tree repository and boosting code reviews.
  7. BinarApps: Active in the GovTool project, BinarApps emerged as one of the most significant contributors in the past year, reflecting its commitment to Cardano’s governance tools.
  8. Sireto Technology: Recently increasing its involvement in governance tools and issue tracking, Sireto’s engagement has grown significantly.
  9. Galois Inc.: Active in the formal specifications and Ouroboros consensus repositories, Galois saw steady contributions, particularly in early 2023.
  10. TxPipe: A more recent but notable contributor, TxPipe increased its code contributions in 2023, focusing on critical infrastructure components.

#### Impact on the Ecosystem:

* The increased activity from diverse organizations signals a robust, growing ecosystem, no longer dependent on a single entity (IOHK). This diversity is essential for the long-term sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem, particularly as it transitions toward more community-led governance and decentralized development.
* The formation of Intersect MBO as a driving force behind open-source contributions, especially in governance-related areas, shows that Cardano is moving into a new phase where multiple organizations share leadership roles, enhancing the resilience of the ecosystem.

#### Challenges:

* The report also notes that while organizations like IOHK, Tweag, and others are driving contributions, there remains a significant challenge in maintaining a balance between engineering work (commits, PRs) and community coordination (issue submission and reviews). The evolving dynamics between these activities will be crucial to monitor in the coming year.

### Cardano in 8 Charts (September 2024)

This companion report provides a visual analysis of the Cardano open-source ecosystem by breaking down its contributions into eight key areas. The report covers the organizational landscape, collaboration dynamics, leadership transitions, contributor stability, and the sustainability of various core projects, with a focus on the Cardano Wallet, GovTool, Catalyst, and Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs).<br>

#### Key Insights:

1. **Organizational Landscape:**
   * A total of 43 organizations contributed to the Cardano ecosystem over the last 12 months, with a core group of 10 driving the majority of contributions.
   * Input Output (IOHK) continues to lead in terms of contributions, but organizations like Tweag, Well-Typed, and BinarApps have increased their contributions, diversifying the leadership of core projects. This shift indicates a move toward more shared governance, especially as organizations like Tweag have become key players in repositories such as ouroboros-consensus and cardano-ledger.
2. **Collaboration Dynamics:**
   * The analysis reveals that 22 organizations contributed code to core repositories, with IOHK being the main bridge between different projects. Tweag and Well-Typed are increasingly important contributors, especially in areas like code reviews and issues.
   * These organizations are not only contributing to core Cardano repositories but also engaging in governance-related projects like Catalyst and GovTool, showing that collaboration is improving across various parts of the ecosystem.
3. **Technical Leadership Transition:**
   * The ecosystem has seen a transition in technical leadership, with organizations like Tweag and Well-Typed taking on larger roles in key repositories. This transition is crucial for the long-term health of the ecosystem as it ensures that no single entity controls the direction of development.
   * The rise of contributors like BinarApps and Sireto Technology, particularly in governance tools, reflects the growing influence of smaller organizations that are taking on leadership roles in specific areas of the ecosystem.
4. **Activity Trends:**
   * Over the past year, there has been a 25% growth in code reviews, which indicates a higher degree of collaboration and focus on improving code quality. The number of code commits and PRs has remained steady, with major contributions coming from IOHK, Tweag, and Well-Typed.
5. **Contributor Stability:**
   * The number of individual contributors remained stable over the last year, with a slight increase in issue submissions and a small decrease in general comments on issues. This stability suggests that the ecosystem’s core contributors remain highly engaged, ensuring consistent development progress.
6. **Newcomers to the Community:**
   * While the overall number of active organizations remained consistent, there was an increase in contributions from new organizations. This diversity in contributors helps reduce dependency on major players like IOHK, making the ecosystem more resilient to changes.
7. **The Impact of Tweag Contributions:**
   * Tweag emerged as a significant contributor, second only to IOHK in several key repositories, such as cardano-ledger and cardano-cli. Tweag’s increased activity shows the organization’s growing influence in shaping the technical direction of the Cardano ecosystem.
8. **Maintenance Challenges:**
   * Despite the positive trends in code contributions, the report highlights an increasing backlog of open issues in several repositories. Key repositories like plutus and cardano-node-tests need to address this backlog to ensure they remain manageable.
   * In contrast, repositories like ouroboros-consensus and cardano-ledger are managing their issue backlog well, with minimal growth over the past year. However, Catalyst repositories are seeing a 29% growth in their backlog, indicating a need for more attention to issue management in this area.

### Conclusions:

The reports highlight the critical role of organizational collaboration in sustaining Cardano's core development. The increasing leadership from groups like Tweag, Well-Typed, and BinarApps signals a positive shift toward a more decentralized and resilient ecosystem.&#x20;

However, challenges still need to be addressed, notably the backlog of issues and pull requests in governance-related repositories, which must be addressed to ensure the ecosystem's health and avoid future development bottlenecks. Overall, the results show an encouraging and positive outlook.
