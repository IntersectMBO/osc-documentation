# 👨‍🏫 Project Support Services

### Request for Project Support: [Support Services Survey](https://forms.clickup.com/9015279944/f/8cnmga8-13635/JABH2WVEOIS8Q4UAGU)

This survey is designed to assist the Open Source Office in determining an appropriate supply timeline and to seek to provde support to as many projects as possible.&#x20;

### Background:&#x20;

In the ever-evolving landscape of Cardano, open source projects serve as catalysts for innovation, driving progress and collaboration. However, the intricacies of managing these projects can present formidable challenges. Recognizing this, Intersect's Open Source Office (OSO) stands ready to provide crucial support services.

### Definition:&#x20;

As the cornerstone of Cardano's open source ecosystem, the OSO acts as a beacon of support and guidance for project teams. Serving as a central hub, it offers a diverse array of resources and expertise to facilitate effective project management. From navigating licensing requirements to fostering community engagement, the OSO empowers teams to maximize the impact and sustainability of their open source endeavors.

### Open Source Office (OSO) Support Services

Intersect’s Open Source Office offers a strong backbone of services to Cardano open source projects, built around the goal of sustaining most project needs outside of just code management and technical decisions. We will offer an enhanced set of services via professional staff that cultivate the maturity and increased adoption of Cardano related open source projects.\
\
We take a data driven approach to working with our project and maintainer community; we actively survey to improve our services and community satisfaction on top of featuring services in our community spotlight/essential cardano/cardano 360.

These services will be offered as part of community stability, but do not replace developers on the projects themselves and are never meant to be in the critical path of a project release or a full time resource. Our goal in providing these shared services is to cultivate projects on Cardano and the builders graduating and incubating projects, offering sandbox projects in the space to grow into incubating projects.
