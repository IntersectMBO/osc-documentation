# 😁 Onboarding Guide for Rust Learners

## 🦀 Rust Language Learning Resources (All Levels)

Rust is a fast, memory-safe systems programming language that is widely used in blockchain development, including infrastructure tools for Cardano and other ecosystems like Solana and Substrate. Its strict compiler, ownership model, and zero-cost abstractions make it ideal for secure, high-performance software.

Below, resources are organized into documentation, tutorials, video walkthroughs, interactive platforms, and Cardano-relevant tooling. A structured learning path at the end will guide you from complete beginner to blockchain-ready developer.

***
