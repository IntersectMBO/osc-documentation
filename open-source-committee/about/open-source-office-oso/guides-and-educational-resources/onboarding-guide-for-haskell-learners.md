# 🤯 Onboarding Guide for Haskell Learners

## Getting Started with Haskell for Cardano Development

Haskell is a statically-typed, purely functional programming language known for its strong type system and reliability. It’s the foundation of Cardano’s smart contract platform **Plutus**, which is implemented as a Haskell library. In fact, the Cardano Developer Portal notes that _“Plutus is the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain”_ allowing developers to write on-chain code in Haskell [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/plutus/#get-started-with-the-plutus-pioneer-program). Because of Haskell’s emphasis on correctness and deterministic behavior, Cardano’s core components (and Plutus smart contracts) are written in or based on Haskell [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/plutus/). In short, learning Haskell is the first step to writing secure, high-assurance Cardano applications.

### Onboarding Journey: From Haskell Novice to Smart Contract Developer

1. **Learn Haskell Basics:** Start with the core language concepts – syntax, types, functions, and basic I/O. Beginner resources like _Learn You a Haskell for Great Good_ [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/plutus/) or _Haskell Programming from First Principles_ (Allen & Moronuki) [github.com](https://github.com/sassela/haskell-learning) can teach you functional programming ideas in an engaging way. IOHK’s free interactive Haskell course (on GitHub) is also designed to take you “from zero to productive” with hands-on Jupyter notebooks [github.com](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course). Focus on small programs and exercises (Project Euler, code katas) to build intuition.
2. **Deepen Functional Skills:** Once you’re comfortable with basics (lists, pattern matching, recursion, typeclasses), explore advanced concepts: monads (IO, `Maybe`, etc.), applicatives, concurrent programming, and type-level features. Good intermediate resources include _Real World Haskell_, _Thinking with Types_, and _Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell_ [github.com](https://github.com/sassela/haskell-learning). Practice by writing real Haskell code or solving challenges on sites like Exercism or HackerRank.
3. **Begin Cardano/Plutus Fundamentals:** Study Cardano’s extended UTXO (EUTXO) model and how smart contracts fit in. Dive into Plutus by following the official tutorials – e.g. the **Plutus Tutorial** on the Cardano Developer Portal – and read introductory blog posts. Crucially, join the **Plutus Pioneer Program** (IOHK’s training course) or review its materials. The Pioneer Program is an in-depth, cohort-based course taught by IOHK educators to train developers in Plutus (the native smart contract language) [github.com](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program)[developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/plutus/). As the Cardano docs advise, _“If you don’t know Haskell yet, consider starting with Haskell”_ before tackling Plutus [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/plutus/).
4. **Build & Deploy Smart Contracts:** Apply your knowledge by writing simple on-chain validators and off-chain code. Use tools like the Plutus Playground or Plutus Application Backend (PAB) to test contracts on Cardano testnets. Study example projects (NFT minting, vesting contracts, decentralized apps) and follow hands-on guides. As you grow, learn about on-chain efficiency (script size/cost) and best practices. Throughout, participate in community channels (Cardano forums, Discord) for support.

### Cardano-Specific Haskell: Plutus and Training

**Plutus (Haskell on Cardano):** Plutus is the native smart contract language for Cardano – essentially a Haskell library for on-chain scripts. The Cardano docs explain that _“Plutus allows all programming to be done from a single Haskell library”_, enabling secure, deterministic smart contracts [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/plutus/#get-started-with-the-plutus-pioneer-program). In practice, you write Haskell code (often called Plutus Tx) that compiles to Plutus Core, the Cardano on-chain VM language. Learning Plutus means learning how to express transaction validators, minting policies, and off-chain infrastructure in Haskell.

**Plutus Pioneer Program:** IOHK’s Plutus Pioneer Program is the flagship training course for Cardano smart contract development. It is an open, intensive curriculum (with weekly videos and exercises) that _“recruits and trains software developers in Plutus, the native smart contract language for the Cardano ecosystem”_ [github.com](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program). Completed at your own pace or in cohort cohorts, the Pioneer Program teaches both Haskell and Plutus best practices. (Past lecture videos and course materials are freely available online.)

**IOG Academy Courses:** The Input Output Group (IOHK) also provides foundational courses. In addition to the Plutus Pioneer, the IOG Education Team created a **Haskell course** for beginners, as well as follow-up tutorials on Plutus Tx and DApp building [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/plutus/) or [github.com](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course). The Haskell course (featuring Jupyter notebooks and video) is specifically designed for programmers new to Haskell. Once ready for Plutus, the Developer Portal and IOHK blog offer guides like “Writing a basic Plutus application” and example projects.

**Other Cardano Resources:** Don’t forget general Cardano dev docs and communities. For example, the Cardano Developer Portal has step-by-step guides (“Plutus resources”, smart contract tutorials) and the Marlowe playground for financial contracts. EMURGO and Community sites (e.g. Essential Cardano) also publish Haskell/Plutus tutorials and newsletters. Engaging with the Cardano Forum and Discord can point you to meetups, hackathons, and mentoring.
