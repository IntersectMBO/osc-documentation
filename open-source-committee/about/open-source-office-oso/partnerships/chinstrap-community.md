# üêß Chinstrap Community

We are excited to announce our strategic partnership with **Chinstrap Community**, a leading advisory group for commercial open source software (COSS). This collaboration strengthens our mission to support sustainable open source development across the Cardano ecosystem. Chinstrap will serve as the official **COSS Strategy Partners** of the Open Source Office at Intersect.

**Key Benefits of the Chinstrap Partnership:**

**Open Office Hours:** Intersect members now have access to free consultation sessions with Chinstrap experts. These office hours provide direct support on licensing, business models, and commercialization strategies tailored to blockchain-native open source projects.

**COSS Education Workshops:** Chinstrap is co-hosting a new workshop series with Intersect focused on open source business fundamentals. These workshops will help project teams explore licensing options, understand open core models, and prepare for long-term sustainability.

**Expert Advisory:** Chinstrap serves as a strategic advisor to the Open Source Office, helping shape licensing policies and supporting Intersect incubating or Cardano wider projects through direct guidance on monetization paths, governance design, and legal best practices.

This partnership reflects our ongoing commitment to open source excellence. With Chinstrap‚Äôs support, we‚Äôre building the foundation for a thriving COSS ecosystem on Cardano.
