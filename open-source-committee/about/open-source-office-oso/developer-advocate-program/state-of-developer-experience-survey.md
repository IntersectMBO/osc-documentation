### Executive Summary

The State of Developer Experience Survey for Cardano aimed to understand developers' and contributors' challenges, motivations, and aspirations of developers and contributors within the Cardano ecosystem. The survey gathered insights from 52 participants, representing diverse experience levels, educational backgrounds, and language proficiencies. Below are the key takeaways:

* The Cardano ecosystem attracts a diverse range of developers, from novices to experienced professionals, who are strongly motivated to contribute and grow within it.
* Addressing challenges related to developer tools, documentation, and technical complexities will be critical for improving productivity and onboarding new developers.
* Language support and multilingual resources are vital for fostering inclusivity and reducing barriers for non-native English speakers. Two-thirds of respondents are willing to volunteer to translate resources into their native languages.
* The community’s willingness to contribute to open-source projects and translation efforts highlights the potential for collaborative growth and innovation.

The insights from this survey will guide the developer advocates and Intersect’s open source committee (OSC) in designing initiatives that address developers' needs, reduce barriers to entry, and empower the community to contribute effectively.
