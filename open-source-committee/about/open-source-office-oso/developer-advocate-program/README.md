Intersect, a member-based organization within the Cardano ecosystem, recognizes the importance of engaging developers and empowering them to contribute effectively to the ecosystem's growth.

To address this need, Intersect launched a Developer Advocate Program, an OSO/OSC initiative. DAP aims to incentivize and support developers who actively participate in various initiatives, working groups, and community-building activities within the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;

By compensating developers for their contributions and providing them with resources and opportunities, Intersect seeks to improve developer experience create a vibrant and thriving developer community within Cardano.
