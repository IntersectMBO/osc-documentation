#### Selection Data

Each applicant received a score from 1-10 pre-interview, applicants that received a 5 or higher were scheduled for an interview. Each applicant was asked the same 10-12 Interview questions, carfeul consideration was given relative to the original answers provided in each application. The below screenshot includes the aggregation of ratings from Committee members that gave a rating for each interviewed applicant. Each question asked was scored on a 1-5 scale. All Committee members had access to recordings in a timely fashion as well as the opportunity to provide their own rating.&#x20;

NOTE: Lower scores are indicative of interviews that remained focused on previous activity that did not actively support the revised goals of the Developer Advocate Program. Applicants with higher scores gave the impression of willingness to adjust their focus to achieve the deliverables of the program as well as a refined focus on connecting with individual contributors.&#x20;
