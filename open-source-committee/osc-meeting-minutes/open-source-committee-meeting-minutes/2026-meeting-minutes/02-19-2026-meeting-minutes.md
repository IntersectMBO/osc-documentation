| Welcome & Quorum                     | Georg opened the meeting. The group discussed favorite seasons while waiting for attendance. Terence confirmed they were at 50% attendance (3 of 6 members). | Meeting proceeded without official quorum; decisions requiring a vote are deferred to Discord or future sessions.    |
| Agenda Overview                      | Georg outlined the agenda: Accelerator changes, MRP interviews, Tooling selection, Program status, Committee elections, and Builderfest.                     | No new items were added to the main agenda.                                                                          |
| Dev Advocate Update                  | Harun and Dan recapped the Africa Tech Summit (CATS) in Nairobi. They met with various community members and recorded a workshop and podcast.                | A survey is ongoing (70/100 responses) before merging with Cardano Foundation data.                                  |
| DX Working Group                     | Harun mentioned rumors of moving the Developer Experience (DX) working group to the Product Committee.                                                       | Terence clarified there are no plans to merge; Dev EX remains tied to the Dev Advocate program.                      |
| Accelerator Program                  | Discussion on "Storm’s" proposal. Due to ROI concerns and technical alignment, the committee is considering a "slimmed-down" version.                        | Plan is to utilize Storm for specific office hours rather than full program ownership.                               |
| MRP Interviews                       | Georg and Sebastian updated the group on Community Maintainer interviews. Several high-quality candidates have been interviewed.                             | Members are encouraged to review interview recordings and scores in the shared Google Drive.                         |
| Tooling Selection                    | Georg highlighted the published selection criteria in the GitBook. Tools can join via self-nomination or committee recommendation.                           | Projects must pass a self-attestation script before entering the evaluation/demo phase.                              |
| Program Status: POSSUM               | Terence provided a rapid update: MRP is moving to version 1.3 (onboarding); Tooling Sustainability needs 4 more tools to hit milestones.                     | Bug Bounty (Bug Bounty) is progressing; GitHoney tooling is expected in early March.                                 |
| Program Status: Operations           | Travel budget is being coordinated for the Open Source Summit (US). Summer of Code (SoC) funds are being returned to the treasury.                           | Programs like "Code for Us" and "Project Support Services" remain pending or undefined for now.                      |
| Committee Elections                  | Elections will now occur once a year. Terence presented draft requirements, including "prior proven contributions" as a recommended background.              | Sebastian suggested clarifying that "contributions" include participation in working groups, not just the committee. |
| Builderfest 2026                     | Sebastian announced that the committee’s talk for Builderfest (March 24) was approved. The focus is on promoting POSM programs.                              | Georg expressed interest in joining as a speaker. Travel budget is available for attendees.                          |
| Upcoming Cadence                     | Terence will be unavailable on March 5. The committee agreed to meet next week (Feb 26) and then skip March 5.                                               | Schedule: Feb 26 (Added), March 5 (Skipped), March 12 (Resume).                                                      |
| New Business: Kenya Student Outreach | Harun was approached by the Kenyan student president association (representing 650k students) for collaboration.                                             | Georg encouraged Harun to explore this; committee travel budget may be available to support university visits.       |
