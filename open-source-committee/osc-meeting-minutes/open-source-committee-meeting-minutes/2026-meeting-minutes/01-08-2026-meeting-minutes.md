## Decisions/Actions

**Decisions**

* **Leadership Succession Plan:** The committee reached a preliminary consensus to move forward with a leadership pairing of Georg as Chair and Udai as Vice Chair, pending a formal vote.
* **Policy on Multi-Program Participation:** The committee agreed in principle that program participants (such as Developer Advocates) are permitted to apply for and participate in multiple programs, provided they have the capacity to handle the workload.
* **Meeting Cadence:** Terence confirmed that the agenda-setting schedule has been corrected and updated for future weeks.

**Actions**

* **Document Signing:** Elaine to sign all necessary pending documents within the next few days to ensure no programs are blocked before her resignation.
* **Leadership Handover Sync:** Georg and Elaine to schedule a 15–20 minute meeting next week to review the specific duties and "day-in-the-life" responsibilities of the Chair.
* **Formal Vote:** The committee needs to conduct an official vote (likely via Discord) to ratify the new Chair and Vice Chair appointments.
* **Documentation Backfill:** Terence to finish backfilling meeting minutes and updating the "Paid Open Source Model" tasks in ClickUp.
* **Process Updates:** Georg to determine if the "multi-program participation" allowance needs to be formally written into the committee’s process documents or if it will remain an informal policy.

| Topic                       | Discussion                                                                                                                             | Notes                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resignation Announcement    | Elaine announced her resignation as OSC Chair, effective in two weeks, due to a new job and personal commitments.                      | Elaine will be fully stepping down as a member to ensure the committee has active leadership.                    |
| Leadership Transition       | Elaine expressed the need for a successor with enough tenure and program knowledge to handle urgent tasks and signing authorities.     | Terence noted that a Vice Chair is also currently needed.                                                        |
| Committee Attendance        | Terence reviewed the roster, noting that the committee is currently at "half capacity" with several members missing (Bernard, Philip). | Quorum and participation levels were briefly discussed.                                                          |
| Chair Nominations           | Udai expressed interest but preferred a veteran member take the lead. Georg volunteered to consider the Chair role.                    | Georg and Elaine planned a 15-20 minute sync next week to discuss Chair responsibilities.                        |
| Vice Chair Discussion       | A potential leadership structure was proposed with Georg as Chair and Udai as Vice Chair.                                              | Jordan agreed with the transition plan but declined interest in the Vice Chair role at this time.                |
| Urgent Admin Tasks          | Terence emphasized the need for a quick vote because several documents require immediate signatures.                                   | Elaine committed to signing pending documents within the next few days before her departure.                     |
| Agenda Setting              | Terence took responsibility for a lapse in the agenda-setting cadence and confirmed the schedule is now updated.                       | Future meeting cadences have been corrected in the system.                                                       |
| Developer Advocate Update   | Uche and Harun provided a status update, noting they are resuming activities for the new year with a sync scheduled today.             | The team is entering the second quarter with high confidence after a challenging first quarter.                  |
| Multi-Program Participation | The committee discussed whether individuals (like Dev Advocates) can participate in multiple programs simultaneously.                  | General consensus is that it is allowed, provided the individual has the time and manages conflicts of interest. |
| Policy on Role Overlap      | Georg suggested formalizing the "active invitation" of current participants into new roles (e.g., Advocate to Maintainer).             | The committee is generally supportive of retaining talent across different program roles.                        |
| ClickUp & Documentation     | Georg and Terence reviewed the transition of meeting minutes and tasks within ClickUp.                                                 | Terence is currently backfilling delayed meeting minutes in the shared workspace.                                |
