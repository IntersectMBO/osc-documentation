| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meeting Logistics           | Reshma noted confusion regarding a "ghost" meeting on her calendar. Udai also joined the incorrect session.                      | Terence clarified the agenda setting meeting is on pause; Discord is the primary source for real-time updates.                          |
| Communication Channels      | Christian asked if the committee prefers Discord or Slack for coordination. Udai noted "channel fatigue" across Intersect.       | The consensus is to remain on Discord for now, stressing the importance of personal attentiveness over the specific tool.               |
| Quorum & Introductions      | The meeting reached a quorum (4 of 7 members) with the arrival of Sebastian.                                                     | Attendees for quorum: Udai, Reshma, Jordan, and Sebastian.                                                                              |
| Developer Advocacy          | Uche provided updates on working groups and onboarding sessions.                                                                 | Focus is currently on the upcoming Cardano Africa Tech Summit.                                                                          |
| Charli3 Incubation          | Robert proposed open-sourcing Charli3’s Oracle infrastructure to solve fragmented data issues in Cardano.                        | Robert is seeking advisory and governance support rather than heavy financial funding.                                                  |
| Funding for Charlie 3       | Udai and Robert discussed the financial requirements for the transition.                                                         | Christian clarified the plan involves a "maintainer retainer" for devs and a small project support request for legal/structural advice. |
| IP & Licensing              | Robert detailed which solutions (Push/Pull Oracles, DEX aggregator) would move to MIT or Apache licenses.                        | Some enterprise-specific forks will remain private to satisfy Web2 client requirements.                                                 |
| Selection Criteria: Tooling | Terence presented the final markup for the Tooling Sustainability Program criteria.                                              | This will move to an asynchronous vote on Discord to expedite milestone forms.                                                          |
| Payment Currency            | Discussion on paying out via the Andamio platform in ADA vs. USD/USDM due to price volatility.                                   | Jordan and Bernard expressed a preference for ADA or native stablecoins (USDM) to manage budget fluctuations.                           |
| Maintainer Retainer Report  | Terence presented a report on the first 15 applicants, with 8 individuals selected.                                              | The committee was asked to sign off on the report; Christian will perform a final review for alignment.                                 |
| OS Summit Minneapolis       | The cost for a gold sponsorship is $38k. Terence noted that ADA’s price dip makes this a significant portion of remaining funds. | Approved: The committee voted to approve the summit today to allow flexibility to act if ADA's price improves.                          |
| OS Summit India             | Potential to sponsor the Mumbai event for $4,650 to get a discount on the North America event.                                   | On Hold: Reshma cannot travel due to personal reasons; decision delayed to see if other attendees (Christian) are available.            |
| Maintainer Program Rd 2     | Eight to nine new applicants have applied for the second round of the maintainer retainer program.                               | Terence requested committee members provide 15–30 minute availability blocks for interviews in February.                                |
| Committee Elections         | Two members (including Chair Georg) are departing in April.                                                                      | Passed: The committee will elect 5 members in April 2026 for two-year terms.                                                            |
| Accelerator Program         | Christian discussed a partnership with Chinstrap and Storm for a 3-part workshop series and a "Demo Day."                        | Funding may be pulled from the "Project Support" bucket to mitigate ADA price drops; Storm will manage delivery.                        |
