| Welcome & Meeting Context         | Terence opened the final meeting of 2025. He noted that Elaine is currently overloaded, so the Open Source Office (OSO) will provide additional support.                                                                     | The next committee review cycle of the OSO is tentatively scheduled for April/May 2026.                   |
| Developer Advocate (DA) Q1 Update | Harun reported that all Q1 milestones have been met by the DAs. He highlighted team cohesion and effective communication via WhatsApp as major successes.                                                                    | Uche expressed appreciation for the collaborative structure of the program.                               |
| DA Working Group Rotations        | Terence proposed rotating DA pairs for the Developer Experience working groups each quarter to keep perspectives fresh.                                                                                                      | Committee members are encouraged to monitor the DA internal channel for updates.                          |
| Member Contributions & Feedback   | Members shared their current focuses: Georg (Maintainer Retainer dashboard), Sebastian (Sustainability group/interviews), Reshma (Technical doc reviews), Jordan (Tooling/promotions), and Bernard (DA focus/Emergo assets). | Reshma noted a preference for technical document review over live verbal discussions.                     |
| Individual Check-ins              | Terence proposed weekly 15-minute 1-on-1 check-ins starting in January to help align individual members with committee goals and clear blockers.                                                                             | Members are to book a 30-minute kickoff session via Terence’s calendar for the first two weeks of Jan.    |
| Milestone Acceptance Process      | Terence demonstrated the ClickUp dashboard used for DA milestones. He requested committee input on whether acceptance criteria are being met.                                                                                | Christian reminded the group that as these are taxpayer-funded, reviews must ensure money is well spent.  |
| Maintainer Retainer Program       | The selection timeline has been extended to January 30th. Additional social media outreach is needed to attract more applicants.                                                                                             | A contract with Andamio is pending for the onboarding platform.                                           |
| Dual Roles (DA as Maintainers)    | A discussion was held on whether DAs can apply for the Maintainer Retainer program. Concerns regarding "double-dipping" vs. ecosystem synergy were raised.                                                                   | Decision Tabled: Members will revisit this in 2026 to decide on a formal policy.                          |
| Tooling Sustainability            | Selection process milestones moved to late January/mid-February. Five tooling projects are expected to be accepted by mid-February.                                                                                          | The Tooling Working Group will go on hiatus over the holiday break.                                       |
| Bug Bounty & Code for Us          | The contract for TX Pipe was sent for signature (Jan 5 – March 5 timeline). This involves developing changes to the GitHoney tooling.                                                                                        | These programs will integrate once the two-month development period concludes.                            |
| Security Incident Manager         | Interviews for this position are occurring this week. The role will involve shared management between the Committee and Intersect.                                                                                           | A final decision/update is expected in early 2026.                                                        |
| Travel & Events Budget            | Members must submit Q1 event requests via the ClickUp travel form. A discussion occurred regarding whether the committee should cover transaction fees for reimbursements.                                                   | Status: Transaction fees were covered this time as the budget allowed and the threshold was not exceeded. |
| Partnerships in 2026              | Bernard inquired about the status of open-source partnerships, specifically in Africa. Terence clarified this is an OSO function but intersects with DA milestones.                                                          | A separate work session on partnership initiatives will be scheduled for 2026.                            |
