| Welcome/Quorum Check                     | Terence noted that the meeting was waiting on the Chair, and upon their arrival, quorum was met.                                                                                                                                                                                        | Jonathan mentioned he was available until the door "knocks."                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Developer Advocate Committee Opportunity | Terence offered Jordan an opportunity to apply to be on the committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Jordan expressed interest and said he would look into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Meeting Kick-off and Agenda Overview     | Terence announced the meeting would begin with an update from the Developer Advocates, followed by an overview of participation expectations, committee elections, the Gitbook, and other detailed topics.                                                                              | Elaine confirmed she was ready to take over as Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Developer Advocate Update                | Elaine requested an update from the Developer Advocates, a topic missed in the previous session. Emmanuel presented the plan for the first quarter focusing on onboarding new participants to Cardano and Intersect open source.                                                        | The plan includes documenting a path for newcomers, creating lessons through a working group, teaching practical skills (e.g., running a node, using SDKs), highlighting contributor paths, and improving core documentation.                                                |
| Developer Advocate Q\&A                  | Lucas asked Emmanuel about reviewing the previous cohort's work and strategies for ensuring attendance at the new sessions.                                                                                                                                                             | Emmanuel clarified the current cohort is laying a missing foundational documentation path for beginners, which will build on the high-level work of previous advocates. He noted efforts to recruit participants, especially in Africa, and through university partnerships. |
| Developer Advocate Tracking              | Terence mentioned there is an open project board to track the Developer Advocates' milestones.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Terence explained the "start from scratch" feeling is due to a lack of formal structure for community involvement in previous meetings, emphasizing that community involvement is the new cohort's focus.                                                                    |
| Guest Speakers/Lurkers                   | Elaine asked if any guests intended to speak, to manage time. Andrew (guest) stated he was mostly a "lurker and learner" but offered to share his 20+ years of open source community experience with Emmanuel. Minh (guest) and Jordan (guest) were also present to listen and support. | Minh asked about accessing the materials (Gitbook, etc.), which Elaine confirmed would be covered.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Meeting Participation Expectations       | Elaine discussed the need for better use of time and committee member contributions. Changes include adding more space between agenda items and the Chair (Elaine will actively call on members with relevant expertise).                                                               | Elaine also mentioned the upcoming ISC requirement for monthly contribution summaries (reporting) to receive stipends. Terence and Christian were asked to be more reserved in meetings to encourage committee discussion/voting.                                            |
| Committee Elections & Status             | Elaine urged committee members to encourage more candidates to apply for the OSC election by the October 24th deadline, noting only four candidates so far.                                                                                                                             | Terence offered to schedule focused X spaces (Tues/Wed/Thurs next week) to market the OSC and encouraged members to participate.                                                                                                                                             |
| OSC Gitbook & Andamio for MRP            | Terence noted that due to a loss of quorum, motions regarding the Gitbook changes and the use of Andamio for the Maintainer Retainer Program (MRP) must be moved to asynchronous voting.                                                                                                | Elaine asked Terence to share the Gitbook link and encouraged members (especially Minh) to read the Paid Open Source Model (POSM) Scoped Items.                                                                                                                              |
| Andamio for MRP Discussion               | Elaine asked for the committee's opinion on Andamio for MRP, expressing a positive outlook. Lucas noted the platform looks mature but requested a formal requirements document from the committee's side to ensure it's fit for purpose.                                                | Terence clarified the previous questions to the Andamio team were meant to suffice as requirements, stating it is the committee's responsibility to provide further requirements if needed. Lucas offered to adapt the existing questions.                                   |
| AI Policy Draft Working Group            | Elaine confirmed the formal motion to launch an AI Working Group has passed. Christian explained the goal is to draft a policy for AI usage in Cardano open source, focusing on governance, licensing, and security.                                                                    | Christian asked members to review 10 general topics he posted in the internal channel and nominate three to prioritize for the initial policy draft. Elaine suggested a guideline against using AI as the sole reviewer for Pull Requests (PRs).                             |
| Accelerator Program Updates              | Christian presented an update on the proposed Accelerator Program, now structured as a series of educational workshops focusing on commercial open source business, fundraising, and technical product review.                                                                          | Christian requested a vote to approve this concept to begin finding vendors (the program is separate from the $50k Accelerator funding). The motion was approved unanimously.                                                                                                |
| Cardano Summer of Code (CSC)             | Christian provided an update on the CSC, noting a proposal from MLABS and an offer from Mahesh (C-Sharp) to incorporate 20-25 universities in India for potentially half the budget.                                                                                                    | Jonathan opposed making the program Haskell-focused, arguing it might turn people away, favoring a focus on more accessible languages for onboarding. Sebastian mentioned TX5's new resource, TX3, for explaining the UTXO model to developers.                              |
| Smart Contract Auditing Working Group    | Christian and Jonathan raised the need for a working group to address the lack of standardization for smart contract auditing on Cardano. A consortium of auditors wants to establish official standards and reference points for different audit levels.                               | The committee voted to establish a thread (not a full channel) in the Discord for this new working group. The motion was approved unanimously.                                                                                                                               |
| Program Update Preferences               | Terence asked the committee how they would prefer to be updated on program progress (contracts, budget, SOW), and how the committee should go about publicizing program updates to the community.                                                                                       | Elaine encouraged all members to provide feedback on this, especially those who are time-limited.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Next Steps/Closing                       | Elaine quickly summarized all topics covered. The final poll results were announced by Terence, confirming all four motions were approved unanimously (Andamio for Gitbook documents, Accelerator Program changes, and Smart Contract Auditing Working Group).                          | The meeting was adjourned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
