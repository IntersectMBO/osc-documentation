The co-chair would co-facilitate meetings and learn the role. If no consensus today, nominations will be gathered via Discord.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Interested members to express interest in the co-chair position via Discord.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Co-Chair Role & Responsibilities               | Pedro Lucas is willing to continue facilitating but would benefit from a co-chair, especially when unable to attend.
