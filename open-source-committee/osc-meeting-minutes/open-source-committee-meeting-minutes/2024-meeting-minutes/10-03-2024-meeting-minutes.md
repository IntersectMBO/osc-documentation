| Lack of Formal Agenda             | The meeting is an open forum due to missing members and no set agenda.                                                                                                | None                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Contribution Ladder Overview      | Christian explained the concept of a contribution ladder for assessing project health and contributor roles in open source projects.                                  | Christian and Alex to collaborate on finalizing the contribution ladder, gathering inputs, and ratifying it with the full committee by the end of October.               |
| Contribution Ladder Issues        | Alex expressed confusion about defining merit and contributor agreements.                                                                                             | Christian and Alex to address the issue of defining merit and develop a clear problem statement for the contribution ladder.                                             |
| Open Source Project Framework     | Discussion on categorizing open source projects by their maturity level (incubation, graduated, abandoned, etc.).                                                     | Christian to finalize the open source project framework and present it to the committee for approval.                                                                    |
| Role of the Open Source Committee | Christian emphasized that the committee’s role is to define best practices for development and project integration in the ecosystem.                                  | Continue to develop guidelines and best practices for the open source projects and contribute to the larger governance model of Intersect.                               |
| Funding and Governance            | Christian outlined how the funding model, certification, and contribution ladder tie into the broader governance and revenue model for Intersect.                     | Prepare documentation for review and ratification after elections, focusing on certification processes, maintainer programs, and governance models.                      |
| Next Steps                        | Christian suggested finalizing documents, including the contribution ladder and project maturity framework, and discussing them after the full committee is in place. | Prepare a formal agenda for the next meeting, finalize contribution ladder documents, and review with the full committee in two weeks. Update documentation accordingly. |
| Meeting Cadence                   | The current meeting schedule is every two weeks on Thursdays, subject to change based on new committee members’ availability.                                         | Terence to update and share the Intersect Events Calendar for easier tracking of recurring meetings and events.                                                          |
