The concern is that strict criteria might lead to disputes if individuals meet the criteria but are not accepted as maintainers due to other factors.</p><p>Adam Dean raises a critical point about the process of selecting paid maintainers, emphasizing the need for a transparent and fair process that includes a clear job description and eligibility requirements.</p><p>The group seems to be working towards a consensus on how to approach these challenges, aiming to create a system that is both structured and flexible enough to accommodate the dynamics of community contribution and project maintenance.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Spontaneously announcements.      | <p>Sebastian Nagel:</p><ol><li>Sebastian nominated Daniel Firtts as a member of the Open-Source Committee instead of him.</li><li>Sebastian Nagel announced his increased involvement with Intersect and established a higher working group, which will work closely with the executive steering and open source committees. Christian Taylor will continue to be involved in this process. They plan to discuss this further next week, with a representative from Intersect joining to help streamline the process. The relationship between the open source committee and the projects, the role of the working groups, and the technical aspects need to be clarified. A ‚Äúworking group‚Äù under the technical steering and open source committees is suggested. Marcin is a test case for this structure, particularly with the governance policy.</li><li>Further exploration is needed, and two people associated with the technical steering and all intersect-related committees will be brought in. Daniel Firth, who is involved with Hydra and Horizon Haskell and is a strong proponent of GitLab, will be brought in to replace Sebastian. The decision was made official with a vote. Daniel is already in the Matrix Channel and will have the appointments on his calendar for next week. He will also be given access to Google Drive and Slack.</li></ol>

| Update from Strategy TWG (Bogdan) | <p>Bogdan Coman led the discussion on the strategic direction for the Cardano Community. The core values and actions were established around openness, legitimacy, citizenship, and quality sustainability. The vision is to enable the successful development and evolution of Cardano as a community-led, decentralized, open-source project, with no single entity dominating its open development.</p><p><br></p><p>Three critical strategic areas or pillars were identified for focus over the next two years: governance and decision-making, sustainability and funding models, and community engagement and collaboration. These pillars align with the community‚Äôs identity and target audience.</p><p><br></p><p>Nicholas Clarke expressed concerns about aligning these strategic areas with the work that needs to be done, particularly in enablement and the ongoing work on security policies. Bogdan Coman suggested that these concerns could be addressed when defining the objectives and actions, ensuring they capture the work already started.</p><p><br></p><p>There was an agreement to establish significant objectives and goals from the strategic pillars. These goals should be aligned with the strategic areas, prioritized, committed, and defined as SMART (Specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely). Bogdan Coman emphasized the importance of individual ownership of goals to ensure accountability and effectiveness. The first goal discussed was to create a self-sustaining economic model for the open source initiative that covers operational costs and funds growth and innovation, with a timeframe to be established.</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian Nagel initiated a discussion on the subject of sustainability, questioning its application to the open source committee and the projects in Intersect. Bogdan Coman clarified that sustainability applies to anyone aligned with the strategy, which could include the Cardano open source.</p><p><br></p><p>Nicholas Clarke expressed concerns about the committee‚Äôs role in developing an economic model for financing, suggesting that the committee should focus on advising on specific topics related to open-source development. He proposed that the committee could advise on the need for funding to maintain continuity, such as the requirement for a certain number of paid contributors.</p><p><br></p><p>Christian Taylor added that while the TSC can decide on suppliers and write contracts, the committee can provide guidance and recommend suppliers for repos but cannot sign any contracts. Sebastian Nagel agreed with these points, suggesting that the open source committee should advise on diversifying maintainers to ensure sustainability. He proposed that at least two independent maintainers should be funded for each component.</p><p><br></p><p>Adam Dean questioned whether sustainability and funding models were within the scope of the committee‚Äôs work and suggested refocusing on something more relevant. Gheorghe-Aurel Pacurar shared a link to the board Bogdan was presenting for further feedback. Bogdan Coman encouraged everyone to provide feedback on the board to help refine the strategy.</p><p><br></p><p>Christian Taylor suggested focusing on sustainability in defining the community's path to becoming independent maintainers. He mentioned a separate call with Silona, where they discussed the need for Intersect's strategy to address the fact that they are no longer a founding entity-owned company and have diversified people working and maintaining the repos.</p><p><br></p><p>Bogdan Coman agreed that sustainability, not funding models, should be the focus, as it encompasses different aspects beyond money. Nicholas Clarke supported this view, emphasizing the importance of technical sustainability.</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian Nagel proposed that to qualify as a component or a core developer, one must not work alone in a silo. He suggested that to be a maintainer, one must work with someone else to maintain a component.</p><p><br></p><p>Nicholas Clarke suggested replacing the self-sustainability goals with issues that provide guidance and policy on what resources are needed to maintain the development of the projects. He also proposed a second objective focusing on the resources necessary to maintain the core products outside any new feature development.</p><p><br></p><p>Bogdan Coman asked Nicholas to insert his proposal in a comment. He suggested establishing a sustainable project framework and creating a rigorous evaluation system to ensure a specific project survival rate over two years.</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian Nagel found the idea of a survival rate attractive and cited the example of a library in the Cardano ecosystem where the most active maintainer is no longer involved. He suggested using this as a case study to understand what happens when a project loses its most active maintainer and test its strategies' effectiveness.</p><p><br></p><p>Christian Taylor suggested changing the term ‚Äúproject framework‚Äù to ‚Äúproject guidelines‚Äù to avoid interfering with project autonomy and to provide best practices. He also pointed out that out of 600 repositories, two called ‚Äúdelete repos‚Äù had been there since 2018.</p><p><br></p><p>Adam Dean highlighted the example of Lucid, a heavily adopted community library that became central to many developers. When the developer left, the library was no longer maintained, leading to three different teams creating their unique forks of the library. This case study underscores the importance of community-driven development.</p><p><br></p><p>Sebastian Nagel proposed that sustainability could also mean maintaining a reasonable level of fragmentation in the community. He suggested an objective to keep the number of forks for any project to a minimum and enable collaboration.</p><p><br></p><p>Christian Taylor proposed targeting Q4 2024 for measurable success, as Intersect is expected to receive funding again in October. He also mentioned the need to reevaluate short-term goals in two months towards the strategy.</p><p><br></p><p>Nicholas Clarke emphasized the need to distinguish between the core Cardano products and other things being pulled in, as they have different requirements. He suggested two sets of guidance: one for maintaining and sustaining the core products and another for community products and supporting tools. He also mentioned the need for a diversified maintainer list onboarding for contributors to each project.</p><p><br></p><p>Christian Taylor proposed diversifying the supplier list, maintaining a diversified list of contributors, and establishing an onboarding path for all projects. He suggested these actions could be broken down into actionable items with specific dates, such as having a project incubation process.</p><p><br></p><p>Bogdan Coman questioned whether these actions related to the four strategic areas already identified or if they were separate proposals. Christian clarified that while these actions spawn from the strategic areas, they are more specific to their current work.</p><p><br></p><p>Nicholas Clarke agreed that while these actions might not necessarily be goals, they are valuable and should be captured. He suggested that these actions could become goals as they identify concrete things that need to be done.</p><p><br></p><p>Christian Taylor proposed a goal to diversify the maintainer list for all projects by the end of 2024. Bogdan Coman agreed that returning to a certain level of diversification is a good goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Bogdan Coman cautioned against starting with actions and trying to fit them into goals. He suggested starting with what they want to achieve and then deciding on better actions.</p><p><br></p><p>The discussion then moved to operating the governance framework, intending to reach a certain percentage of decisions made with direct community involvement by a specific date. This goal aims to ensure transparency inclusivity, and empower long-term sustainability. The governance framework is published in Gitbook, and a document is in Google Docs. Sebastian Nagel questioned the feasibility of measuring and presenting decisions, given the difficulty of knowing the total number of decisions in the framework.</p><p><br></p><p>Adam Dean expressed concerns about setting a fixed increase in the number of developers as a goal, arguing that it could lead to unworthy candidates being chosen just to meet the goal. Christian Taylor suggested measuring the increase in contributions based on their current status and proposed a goal for governance and decision-making hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Nicholas Clarke agreed with Adam and Christian, suggesting an active contributor could be a better metric. He proposed setting a goal to have regular external, non-funded contributors to each core Cardano project by the end of the year, acknowledging that this goal could fail.</p><p><br></p><p>Christian Taylor highlighted the Bitergia analytics tool, which defines contributions by casual, regular, and core contributors. He suggested using this tool to measure the baseline and aim for a higher number. He Another proposal is to increase the merge ratio on open-source projects as another possible measurement.</p><p><br></p><p>Bogdan Coman mentioned a comment from Michael about cycle time as a potential goal. The team agreed to consider these proposals and refine the goals further.</p><p><br></p><p>Nicholas Clarke and Christian Taylor discussed the importance of metrics such as time for a PR to go through stages and time to resolve sustainability issues. They agreed that these metrics could answer the goal of essential sustainability of the core projects.</p><p>Bogdan Coman summarized the proposals and outlined the following steps: taking feedback and coming up with the next iteration for these goals. He noted the need for another session to discuss the new proposal due to time constraints.</p><p>Christian Taylor proposed updating the technical working group time to include everyone who can make it and working with Bogdan Coman to define these and get some actions as proposals. He also assigned homework for everyone to add comments and feedback and propose actions before Wednesday.</p><p>Marcin Szamotulski announced that he would be off the following week. Nicholas Clarke noted that many people would be away the next Friday due to a holiday. Christian Taylor suggested moving the call to Thursday so everyone can vote on the ratification.</p><p>The meeting concluded with welcomes to Daniel Firth and wishes for a good weekend.</p><p>Nicholas Clarke and Christian Taylor discussed the importance of metrics such as time for a PR to go through stages and time to resolve sustainability issues.
