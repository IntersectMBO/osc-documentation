# Developer Experience Working Group

## Purpose & Goal

The Developer Experience (DevEx) Working Group exists to **onboard, support, and empower developers and contributors** in the Cardano ecosystem. Our mission is to identify, address, and improve key aspects of the development process to make building on Cardano more accessible, efficient, and rewarding.

We focus on onboarding and educating developers while continuously seeking to improve the Developer Experience for working on Cardano, starting with Core Cardano and evolving to improve the experience building anywhere in the Cardano ecosystem.
