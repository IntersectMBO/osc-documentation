# Bitergia Repo Maturity Reports

Welcome to the central hub for Intersect’s **Open Source Maturity Reports**, a monthly publication powered by analytics from **Bitergia** and produced by Intersect’s Open Source Office.

These reports offer transparent, data-driven insights into the ongoing development and decentralization of Cardano’s open-source ecosystem. They help ecosystem stakeholders — including contributors, core teams, governance bodies, and community members — understand how Cardano is evolving month by month.

### 🧠 What These Reports Cover

Each report tracks and analyzes:

* **Contributor Activity** – Who is building, where they contribute, and how frequently
* **Codebase Health** – Trends in commits, PRs, issues, and modified files
* **Organizational Engagement** – Participation from key entities like IOHK, Cardano Foundation, and independent teams
* **Geographic Distribution** – The global spread of development efforts across time zones
* **Project Maturity** – Activity across core repos such as `cardano-node`, `plutus`, `ouroboros-consensus`, and others
* **Decentralization Trends** – Signals that indicate growing autonomy, diversity, and accountability within the ecosystem

These insights guide strategy, strengthen governance, and ensure long-term sustainability for Cardano’s open-source development model.\
