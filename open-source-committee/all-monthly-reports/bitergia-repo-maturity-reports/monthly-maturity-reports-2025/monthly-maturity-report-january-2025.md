# Monthly Maturity Report - January 2025

### Summary

In **January 2025**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem experienced a strong rebound in delivery activity, paired with deeper structural and quality-focused development. While contributor count remained stable, total output — including commits, modified files, and pull requests — increased significantly. Key system repositories such as **Ouroboros Consensus**, **Plutus**, and **Cardano Ledger** saw large surges in structural changes, while issue resolution times dropped dramatically, reflecting improved triage and engineering efficiency. The data suggests a coordinated milestone effort across the core infrastructure, matched by expanded QA engagement and community participation.

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions:

* **IOHK** increased commit volume by 50% and touched over 6,500 files, suggesting aggressive sprint work or system-wide upgrades.
* **Well-Typed**, **Cardano Foundation**, and **Tweag** all increased contributions, indicating renewed engineering engagement after year-end lulls.
* **Unknown contributors** rose significantly in both commits and issue submissions — reinforcing growing open-source participation.

#### Geographical Distribution:

* **European time zones (UTC +1, 0)** led January’s resurgence with >75% growth in commits.
* **Pacific US (UTC −7)** activity declined slightly, while **new regional contributors** appeared from UTC −4 and +11, suggesting expanding ecosystem reach.

#### Project-Level Activity:

* **Ouroboros Consensus** and **Plutus** posted 400–500% increases in modified files, likely due to protocol updates and modularization work.
* **Cardano CLI** and **Ledger** also surged, pointing to both developer tooling improvements and foundational layer refactoring.

#### Repository Focus:

* **Cardano-node** remained the most active repository with consistent delivery levels.
* A wider range of repositories (25) received PRs, reflecting broadened delivery scope and ecosystem integration.

#### Quality Assurance Trends:

* **Issues submitted rose by 85%**, while resolution time **dropped from 43 to 22 days**, signaling faster feedback loops.
* Organizations like **IOHK**, **Well-Typed**, and **Cardano Foundation** submitted more issues and resolved them faster — suggesting stronger internal QA cycles.

### Conclusion

**January 2025** marked a strong reactivation phase across the Cardano ecosystem. The return to high-volume contributions, deep file-level modifications, and faster issue resolution reflects a community in delivery mode. Core contributors maintained focus while new and unaffiliated actors gained traction. Looking ahead, sustaining this throughput and extending engagement across more organizations and repositories will be key to scaling the ecosystem and delivering on roadmap milestones.
