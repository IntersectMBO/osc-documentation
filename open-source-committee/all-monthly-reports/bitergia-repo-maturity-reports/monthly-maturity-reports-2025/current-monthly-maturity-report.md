# Monthly Maturity Report - July 2025

#### Summary

In July 2025, the Cardano open-source ecosystem entered a broad-based acceleration phase, reversing June’s contraction and delivering one of the most active months in recent cycles. Total contributions surged across nearly all activity metrics, with commits doubling (+101%), pull requests climbing (+70.7%), and issues increasing (+79.7%). Code volume expanded sharply, driven by a +651% jump in modified files — signaling large-scale structural updates, feature integrations, and dependency changes. IOHK maintained its position as the central engineering driver, while Intersect MBO emerged as a major open-source contributor, and unaffiliated (“Unknown”) contributors posted unprecedented growth.\
The spike in governance-related development was evident with the debut of govtool and the rapid scaling of formal-ledger-specifications. Contributor participation grew geographically diverse, with especially strong gains from North and South American time zones (UTC−5, UTC−4).

**General Observations**

Organizational Contributions

* IOHK led with 1,086 contributions and 46 authors — a +37.5% increase in contributions, sustaining its ecosystem leadership.
* Intersect MBO surged with +11,500% growth in contributions, reflecting its formal integration into open-source workflows.
* “Unknown” authorship grew by +1,040%, showing strong onboarding of unaffiliated or newly mapped contributors.
* Tweag contributions rose +163%, while Well-Typed held steady in authors but dipped slightly in contribution volume (−1.5%).

***

Repository Activity

* cardano-ledger (+92.9%), plutus (+158.6%), and cardano-api (+109.4%) led commit growth, indicating active protocol and tooling development.
* Governance-related repositories (govtool, formal-ledger-specifications) entered the top activity tier, showing strategic expansion into governance tooling.
* Core protocol repos like ouroboros-consensus (+55%) and cardano-node (+63.3%) maintained strong throughput.

***

Pull Requests

* 442 PRs were submitted (+70.7%) across 27 repositories by 67 contributors.
* IOHK sustained leadership with 285 PRs, while Intersect MBO (64 PRs) and “Unknown” contributors (35 PRs) expanded sharpl
* Liqwid Labs PR volume rose +400%, reflecting targeted delivery efforts.

***

Issue Lifecycle

* Total issues rose by +79.7%, with unique submitters increasing +39.3% and repository coverage expanding +18.2%.
* Median open times remained stable at 8.5 days, showing sustained triage efficiency despite higher volume.
* High-growth repositories included govtool (26 issues in its debut month) and formal-ledger-specifications (+1,100%).

***

Contributor Participation

* Active contributor counts grew to 83 (+38.3%), with gains spread across multiple organizations and unaffiliated contributors.
* The diversity of commit and PR sources indicates deeper decentralization of development activity.

***

Geographic Representation

* UTC−5 and UTC−4 posted triple-digit gains in commit activity (+378.6% and +250% respectively), signaling increased participation from the Americas.
* UTC−3 returned to activity after being inactive in June, while UTC−6 remained stable and UTC−7 grew moderately.
* No single time zone dominated commit volume, maintaining a distributed global footprint.

Conclusion\
\
July 2025 reflected a high-velocity growth phase, with major increases in contributions, repository coverage, and governance-focused development. Intersect MBO was a large-scale contributor, alongside surging unaffiliated participation, marking a clear decentralization trend in Cardano’s engineering base. Coupled with geographic diversification and strong gains across both protocol and tooling projects, the ecosystem enters Q3 with momentum, expanded capacity, and broader participation than in previous cycles.
