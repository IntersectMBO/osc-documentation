# Monthly Maturity Report - February 2025

### Summary

In **February 2025**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem experienced its **busiest month on record**, characterized by substantial increases in commit volume, contributor engagement, and code refinement. While many core repositories saw steady or even declining commit counts, this masked a larger systemic surge across governance tools, smart contract infrastructure, and QA pipelines.

Key contributors — including **IOHK**, **Well-Typed**, **Sireto Technology**, and **BinarApps** — dramatically scaled up delivery and QA activity, while contributor counts ballooned due to increased data attribution fidelity and potentially expanded workforce integration. Issue resolution times plummeted across the board, even as feedback volume skyrocketed — signaling maturity and responsiveness in engineering workflows.

***

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions

* **Input Output (IOHK)** maintained leadership with 769 commits, but contributor count surged to 928 — a 1,500% increase over January — likely tied to attribution improvements or large-scale parallel workstreams.
* **BinarApps** and **Sireto Technology** debuted with over 100 contributors each, suggesting new partnerships or team onboarding.
* **Well-Typed** and **Unknown** also expanded sharply, helping to decentralize engineering momentum across the ecosystem.

#### Geographic Activity

* The **UTC +5** zone (India/Central Asia) saw a 732% increase in commits, while **UTC 0** and **+1** zones remained dominant.
* Commit activity rebounded in Central America (UTC -6), but dropped in Pacific Time (UTC -7), indicating shifting team focus or capacity.

#### Repository Prioritization

* **Govtool** went from 0 to 185 commits, signaling an intensive build phase for governance infrastructure.
* **Ouroboros-consensus** rose 49%, while **Cardano-node** dropped 22% — possibly transitioning to stabilization.
* **Cardano-api** saw a 616% rise in file changes, likely reflecting integration and tooling enhancements.

#### Code Volume

* 9,897 files were modified in February (+3%), with over **311K lines** **added** and **599K removed** — the largest cleanup effort in recent history.
* These changes point to **refactoring, simplification, and technical debt reduction** across critical modules.

#### Issue Lifecycle

* **190 issues** were submitted (+78%), with average resolution time down to **9.2** days from **22.1** — a 59% improvement.
* **Govtool**, **Formal-ledger-specifications**, and **Plutus** saw major QA surges, as protocol-critical projects moved through test cycles.

#### Pull Requests

* **528 PRs** were submitted — up 39% — reflecting deeper integration, bug fixes, and implementation bursts.
* PRs were concentrated in 25 repositories, reinforcing delivery focus on key initiatives.

### Conclusion

**February 2025** marked a **watershed month for delivery, testing, and organizational scale** across Cardano open-source efforts. The ecosystem achieved **record-high engineering throughput**, expanded its contributor base, and rapidly iterated on core systems — all while maintaining high QA responsiveness. The challenge going forward will be to sustain this momentum, distribute ownership across more contributors and orgs, and build durable delivery practices around these peaks in activity.
