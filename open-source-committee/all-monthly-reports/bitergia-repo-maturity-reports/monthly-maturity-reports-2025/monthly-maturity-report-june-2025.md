# Monthly Maturity Report- June 2025

Summary

In June 2025, the Cardano open-source ecosystem entered a focused contraction phase following the delivery-heavy months of Q2. While total contributions declined across most activity metrics, code volume surged — with lines added and removed more than tripling. This shift reflects a transition from active feature delivery to architectural refinement and backlog resolution. IOHK remained the central engineering driver, while unaffiliated contributors re-emerged with notable activity.

The return of “Unknown” contributors marked a shift in attribution patterns, indicating the presence of new or unmapped participants. Repository-level distribution remained steady, with key infrastructure projects like cardano-cli, ouroboros-network, and cardano-ledger sustaining development. Contributor participation stayed globally distributed, with a significant increase from American time zones.

#### General Observations

Organizational Contributions

* IOHK led with 682 contributions and 46 authors — a −17.9% decline from May, while still maintaining ecosystem leadership.
* Tweag (−50%) and Well-Typed (−25%) saw decreased author presence, suggesting a transition to maintenance or inactivity.
* Unknown authorship rose by 200%, reflecting new unaffiliated contributors or unmapped GitHub accounts entering the ecosystem.

***

Repository Activity

* ouroboros-network (+129%) and cardano-cli (+56%) posted major gains in commit volume, indicating renewed focus on network and CLI tooling.
* cardano-ledger (−50%) and cardano-node (−68%) experienced significant drops, likely reflecting completed delivery milestones.
* plutus remained the top PR destination with 34 pull requests, despite a −37% decrease from May.\
  \


***

Pull Requests

* 259 PRs were submitted (−35.1%) across 17 repositories by 54 contributors.
* IOHK sustained its lead with 205 PRs, while Well-Typed and Quviq reduced output significantly.
* Unknown contributors submitted 17 PRs — a sharp increase from just 3 in May, suggesting improved onboarding or expanded unaffiliated activity.\
  \


***

Issue Lifecycle

* Total issues dropped by 72.8%, reflecting the end of May’s backlog flush.
* Average resolution time fell from 202.5 days to just 7.9 days (−96.1%), indicating rapid triage of remaining open issues.
* cardano-node and ouroboros-consensus saw the highest issue engagement, confirming their status as protocol hotspots.\
  \


***

Contributor Participation

* Total contributions declined across the board, with 60 unique contributors (−17.8%) active in June.
* IOHK, Tweag, and Well-Typed remained key players, while Quviq held steady with 1 contributor.
* The rise in “Unknown” contributors highlights growing unaffiliated participation and potential new onboarding flows.

***

Geographic Representation

* Time zone activity continued to diversify, with UTC−5 (Americas) rising by +250% — the largest increase of any region.
* UTC−4 and UTC−6 also expanded, while UTC+1 through UTC+3 saw moderate declines.
* No single time zone dominated overall commit volume, maintaining a distributed global footprint.\

#### Conclusion

June 2025 reflected a healthy stabilization period, marked by reduced surface-level activity and increased backend development. Contributor participation remained globally distributed, and repositories showed sustained focus on refinement and infrastructure. With core components under active development and new participants entering, Cardano’s open-source foundation remains strong and well-positioned for momentum in Q3.
