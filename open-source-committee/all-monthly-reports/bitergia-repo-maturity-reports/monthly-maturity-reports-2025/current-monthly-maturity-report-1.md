# Monthly Maturity Report - September 2025

#### Summary

In **September 2025**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem continued its transition into a stabilization and refinement phase following August. Overall contributions moderated across most activity metrics, signaling the close of large-scale delivery cycles and the start of sustained optimization. **Commits declined** modestly **(−9.4%)**, **pull requests dipped** slightly **(−7.3%)**, and **issues decreased** **(−13.9%)** as teams shifted focus from feature expansion to performance tuning, QA, and documentation improvements.

Despite this normalization, ecosystem participation remained strong. IOHK continued to anchor Cardano’s engineering output, maintaining the highest contribution share. Intersect MBO sustained its open-source delivery cadence, integrating governance-related and infrastructure workstreams into the broader ecosystem. Unknown contributors expanded their presence (+7.3%), further advancing Cardano’s ongoing decentralization of development.

Governance-related repositories (govtool) remained among the most active, while cardano-ledger, plutus, and cardano-api continued steady throughput on protocol and tooling enhancements. Contributor participation remained globally distributed, with a surge in UTC +10 (Asia-Pacific) offsetting lighter output from the Americas.

#### General Observations

Organizational Contributions

* IOHK led with 1,018 total contributions (−6.8%) and 47 active authors, sustaining its ecosystem leadership.
* Intersect MBO maintained consistent output (−5.3%), demonstrating operational maturity in its open-source integration.
* Unknown contributors increased +7.3%, reinforcing continued community growth and decentralization.
* Tweag (−5.3%) and Well-Typed (−3.3%) recorded marginal slowdowns, consistent with a consolidation phase after earlier delivery spikes.

Repository Activity

* govtool (−5.7%) and plutus (−7.4%) remained top activity centers, indicating continued investment in governance tooling and smart contract infrastructure.
* cardano-ledger (−9.5%) and ouroboros-consensus (−4.8%) sustained strong protocol-level engagement.
* formal-ledger-specifications (−11.1%) continued trending downward slightly as it transitioned into verification and maintenance stages.

<br>

Pull Requests

* 406 PRs were submitted (−7.3%) across 26 repositories by 65 contributors.
* IOHK remained dominant with 269 PRs (−6.6%), while Intersect MBO (62 PRs) and Unknown contributors (38 PRs) sustained stable participation.
* Liqwid Labs and community contributors posted modest gains, reflecting consistent decentralized activity.

Issue Lifecycle

* Total issues declined to 118 (−13.9%) with faster median resolution times (−4.9%), reflecting increased QA efficiency.
* IOHK continued leading issue creation and resolution, while “Unknown” contributors expanded engagement by +33%.
* Governance-related projects (govtool, formal-ledger-specifications) showed improved turnaround, signaling process maturity.

Contributor Participation

* The active contributor base remained stable at 85 (−2.3%), with participation distributed across all major organizations and independent contributors.&#x20;
* The sustained global footprint across UTC −7 to +10 underscores Cardano’s resilient, multi-regional engineering ecosystem.

Geographic Representation

* &#x20;UTC +10 posted the strongest growth (+40.3%), reflecting renewed activity from Asia-Pacific contributors.
* UTC +1 and +2 remained consistent, maintaining Europe’s core engineering presence.
* North and South American zones (UTC −5 to −3) moderated following two months of accelerated activity, marking a balanced global distribution.

#### Conclusion

**September 2025** represented a consolidation period following two high-velocity development cycles. The Cardano open-source ecosystem sustained broad participation, efficient collaboration, and strong output across key repositories, even as overall volumes normalized. IOHK continued to provide technical depth, Intersect MBO demonstrated sustained operational maturity, and community contributors expanded their footprint — collectively reinforcing the ecosystem’s decentralization and structural resilience.

Cardano closed Q3 2025 with measurable stability and balanced contributor engagement, better positioning the ecosystem for continued momentum entering Q4.
