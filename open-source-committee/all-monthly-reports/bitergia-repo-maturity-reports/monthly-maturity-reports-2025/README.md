# Monthly Maturity Reports - 2025

Welcome to the official index of Cardanoâ€™s **Open Source Maturity Reports** for 2025, published monthly by Intersectâ€™s Open Source Office.

These reports offer a comprehensive view into the health, evolution, and engagement patterns of Cardanoâ€™s open-source ecosystem. Each edition provides data-backed insights across key areas:

* **Contributor Activity** â€“ Who is building, how many, and where from
* **Repository Metrics** â€“ Commits, PRs, issues, and code volume across core and emerging projects
* **Organizational Engagement** â€“ Analysis of contributions by key engineering partners
* **Geographic Distribution** â€“ How decentralized development is across time zones
* **Strategic Signals** â€“ Trends, anomalies, and shifts that matter to Cardanoâ€™s open-source future

These monthly reports support transparency, guide project planning, and help ecosystem stakeholders track the long-term sustainability and decentralization of development on Cardano.\
\
Open source metrics are varied in type and format. Our strategic Partners at [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/) assist the Open Source Office in keeping things organized and appropriately detailed. Find our reports for 2025 below.&#x20;
