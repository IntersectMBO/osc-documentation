# Monthly Maturity Report- May 2025

#### Summary

In May 2025, the Cardano open-source ecosystem maintained a steady delivery cadence, following April’s structural normalization. While total contributions declined from April’s elevated levels, key metrics such as issue volume, contributor diversity, and repository coverage signaled durable engagement and broader ecosystem participation. Emerging contributors like Quviq and sustained investment from IOHK underscored the ecosystem’s stability and onboarding capabilities.

The elimination of “Unknown” contributors marked a major attribution improvement, enhancing the accountability of open-source activity. Repository-level distribution remained healthy, with cardano-ledger, cardano-node, and ouroboros-consensus showing notable PR growth — reflecting a shift toward protocol evolution and infrastructure hardening. Contributor participation remained geographically diverse, with distributed commit activity across all time zones.

#### General Observations

Organizational Contributions

* IOHK led with 819 contributions and 56 authors — a +3.7% increase in contributor count from April, underscoring its pivotal engineering role.
* Tweag (+33%) and Quviq (new) increased author presence, while Well-Typed (−33%) and Cardano Foundation (−50%) saw minor declines.
* Unknown authorship dropped to zero, reflecting improved identity mapping and contributor traceability.

***

Repository Activity

* cardano-ledger (+31%) and cardano-node (+64%) posted major gains in PR volume, reflecting protocol evolution work
* ouroboros-consensus and cardano-cli continued consistent activity, showing maintenance and CLI refinements.
* plutus held the top position for PRs despite a slight dip, while cardano-node-tests dropped 40%, suggesting test framework stabilization.

***

Pull Requests

* 424 PRs were submitted (+1.8%) across 24 repositories by 63 contributors.
* Submitter diversity increased, with new orgs such as Quviq entering PR flows.
* Distribution of PRs became more even across repositories, indicating healthier load balancing in core dev activity.

***

Issue Lifecycle

* Issue volume rose 18%, with contributions from IOHK, Galois, and formal methods teams.
* Resolution times remained stable, and critical repo responsiveness (e.g. plutus, formal-ledger-specs) stayed high.
* Issue attribution improved — “Unknown” issue sources disappeared entirely.

***

Contributor Participation

* Total contributions dropped from 5,676 to 1,073 (−81%), reflecting a cooldown from April’s spike.
* Unique contributors held strong at 73, indicating a stable participation base.
* IOHK, Tweag, and Well-Typed accounted for most activity, with Quviq joining formally.
* The sharp drop in anonymous contributions supports the push toward greater accountability.

***

Geographic Representation

* Time zone distribution broadened again, with strong commit activity from UTC+1, UTC+2, UTC+3, and UTC+10 — sustaining decentralization across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific.
* UTC+0 (Western Europe and Africa) and UTC−5 (North America) maintained steady presence.
* No single time zone dominated commit volume, reinforcing a global development footprint
* UTC+10 (Australia and East Asia) continued its emergence as a growing technical hub.

#### Conclusion

May 2025 reflected a period of healthy stabilization following a peak sprint cycle in March–April. The ecosystem retained strong contributor diversity, added new formal participants, and improved accountability through better GitHub attribution. With core repositories gaining momentum and decentralized geographic activity holding firm, Cardano’s open-source infrastructure remains resilient and well-positioned for deeper integration and infrastructure scaling in Q2 and beyond.
