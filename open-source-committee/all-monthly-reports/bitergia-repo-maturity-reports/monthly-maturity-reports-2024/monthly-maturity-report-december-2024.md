# Monthly Maturity Report - December 2024

### Summary

In **December 2024**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem sustained development momentum across core repositories despite a notable drop in surface-level contribution volume. While metrics such as pull requests and issues declined — reflecting end-of-year slowdowns — **code volume and repository coverage expanded**, suggesting that small, focused teams continued work on complex or foundational updates. Community participation remained steady, with new organizations and contributors submitting issues and expanding the contributor base. However, major contributors like **IOHK and Well-Typed showed drastic declines in logged contributions**, largely due to changes in reporting structure. Overall, the ecosystem demonstrated resilience and technical depth heading into 2025.

***

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions:

* **IOHK** led again in absolute author count, but their commit and contribution counts dropped \~94%, likely due to reporting anomalies, not decreased activity.
* **Tweag** saw a 154% increase in commits and contributed over **681K lines**, indicating major delivery on infrastructure components.
* **Well-Typed and Cardano Foundation** recorded steep declines in commits and issues, though likely impacted by seasonal shifts and/or data changes.
* **Unaffiliated (Unknown)** contributors remained active, with increases in both commits and issues — reinforcing the value of decentralized community engagement.

***

#### Geographical Distribution of Commits:

* **UTC -7 (Pacific U.S.)** rose sharply (+60%), becoming the second most active zone.
* **UTC +1 and 0 (Europe)** dropped by over 30%, suggesting a **seasonal slowdown across European contributors**.

***

#### Project-Specific Insights:

* **Cardano-node** commits nearly doubled (100 → 194), becoming the top repository — a sign of concentrated delivery in core infrastructure.
* **Cardano-base and formal-ledger-specifications** saw triple-digit growth in modified files, reflecting renewed work on base libraries and validation layers.
* **Plutus, Cardano-ledger, and Ouroboros-consensus** all saw declines in issue submissions and commit activity, pointing to **stabilization or end-of-cycle states**.

***

#### Repository & Issue Activity:

* Pull requests dropped by 31%, but repository coverage stayed constant — suggesting **slower, deeper work within the same project scope**.
* Issue submissions fell (−32.6%), but resolution time improved (−15%), with more projects receiving attention — a **positive signal for QA efficiency**.
* **Community and external engagement increased**, with organizations like **TUM and Tweag submitting issues after prior inactivity**.

***

### Conclusion

The **December 2024** maturity report reflects a period of **quiet but concentrated progress**. While high-level activity dipped, deeper repository and file-level data reveals ongoing technical work in core libraries and system layers. A reduced but steady contributor base — including growth from unaffiliated developers — carried forward the ecosystem’s development. Looking into 2025, the priority should be to maintain this technical depth while re-activating broader contributor participation and sustaining efficient issue response cycles.
