# Monthly Maturity Report - October 2024

## Summary:

In **October 2024**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem maintained a **steady development pace**, while showing signs of **focus, stability, and internal consolidation**. Commit activity increased slightly from the prior month, even as the number of active authors declined â€” suggesting that a smaller core group handled more of the workload. Issue submissions fell significantly, as did the number of repositories receiving issues, pointing to a reduced testing or QA footprint. However, code changes remained distributed across many key repositories, and pull request and contribution volume held stable. Notably, smaller contributors like Tweag and Quviq saw sharp increases in engagement, and ecosystem participation extended across more repositories. Collectively, the data suggests that the Cardano engineering ecosystem is maturing, **trimming surface-level activity while reinforcing depth and continuity** in its core projects.
