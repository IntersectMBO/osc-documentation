# Monthly Maturity Report - October 2024

### Summary:

In **October 2024**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem maintained a **steady development pace**, while showing signs of **focus, stability, and internal consolidation**. Commit activity increased slightly from the prior month, even as the number of active authors declined — suggesting that a smaller core group handled more of the workload. Issue submissions fell significantly, as did the number of repositories receiving issues, pointing to a reduced testing or QA footprint. However, code changes remained distributed across many key repositories, and pull request and contribution volume held stable. Notably, smaller contributors like Tweag and Quviq saw sharp increases in engagement, and ecosystem participation extended across more repositories. Collectively, the data suggests that the Cardano engineering ecosystem is maturing, **trimming surface-level activity while reinforcing depth and continuity** in its core projects.

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions:

* **Input Output (IOHK):** Maintained its leadership position with 913 contributions, slightly up from 879 in September. While added and removed lines decreased dramatically, the breadth of modified files and sustained commit activity indicate a period of refinement and stabilization.
* **Tweag:** Jumped from 28 to 111 contributions — a nearly 4x increase — driven by a small team, suggesting **focused engagement or a dedicated delivery sprint**.
* **Well-Typed:** Contributions dropped by 31% (151 to 104), suggesting a **winding down of recent efforts** or shifting team focus.
* **Cardano Foundation and Quviq:** Both posted major percentage gains in contributions, albeit from small baselines, highlighting **renewed or expanded ecosystem participation**.

***

#### Geographical Distribution of Commits:

* **UTC +2 (Central Europe):** Remained dominant with 533 commits, slightly down from 542 — maintaining its role as the core contributor zone.
* **UTC +1 (Western Europe):** Saw a dramatic 102% increase in commits, pointing to heightened activity in that region.
* **UTC -6 and -4 (North America):** Activity remained stable, with a mild decline in UTC -6 and modest growth in UTC -4.

***

#### Project-Specific Insights:

* **Cardano-ledger** led all repositories with 185 commits and a 46.8% increase over September, indicating **major development attention**.
* **Plutus** maintained high activity with 113 commits and remained the most modified in terms of estimated file changes.
* **Cardano-cli** saw reduced issue volume (−37.5%) and commits, reflecting **potential stabilization or feature freeze**.
* **Ouroboros-network** saw a 23% increase in modified files, reinforcing its importance in ongoing protocol work.
* **Cardano-node** dropped slightly in both commits and file-level impact, possibly signaling a post-release cooldown.

***

#### Repository Activity:

* Pull requests rose from 419 to 437, while touched repositories increased from 20 to 21 — **suggesting broader integration efforts**.
* The number of contributors submitting PRs fell by 12.5%, reinforcing the trend of **higher output from fewer developers**.
* Total issues dropped by nearly 28%, with affected repositories shrinking from 30 to 11 — indicating a possible **reduction in testing scope or triage volume**.
* Despite the drop, resolution times improved, showing that existing teams are handling issues **more efficiently**.

***

### Conclusion

The **October 2024** report reflects a **phase of concentrated, high-efficiency development** across the Cardano open-source ecosystem. A smaller, dedicated group of contributors drove much of the progress, while peripheral engagement declined. Fewer repositories received issues, but PR and commit activity remained healthy. Key infrastructure components like **Cardano-ledger**, **Plutus**, and **Ouroboros-network** continued to evolve steadily. As the ecosystem matures, sustaining this momentum while **diversifying contributors and enhancing QA coverage** will be critical to supporting long-term resilience and progress.
