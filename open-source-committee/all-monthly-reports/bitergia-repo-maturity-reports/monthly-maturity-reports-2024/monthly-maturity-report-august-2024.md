# Monthly Maturity Report - August 2024

### Summary

In **August 2024**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem entered a phase of focused, high-impact development. While total contributions, pull requests, and active contributors declined across many organizations, the scale of work on core repositories increased dramatically. Key projects like **Cardano Node**, **Plutus**, and **DB Sync** saw significant surges in code volume and targeted activity, signaling a major internal development cycle. Contributions remained led by **Input Output (IOHK)**, though other core contributors such as **Tweag** and **Well-Typed** scaled back. The data also points to a slowdown in issue resolution, with rising median open times, suggesting growing complexity or temporary triage delays. Overall, the ecosystem is undergoing a strategic narrowing of focus while sustaining meaningful progress on critical infrastructure.

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions:

* **Input Output (IOHK):** Continued to lead with 851 contributions, though this marks a sharp drop from 3,513 in July. However, IOHK added over 4.9 million lines of code — up from just 234,120 — indicating a major release or system overhaul.
* **Tweag and Well-Typed:** Contributions fell significantly, with Tweag dropping from 694 to 136, and Well-Typed from 539 to 81. This may reflect a pause in activity following intense development cycles earlier in the quarter.
* **Intersect MBO:** Contribution data was not available for August, indicating either no reported activity or a reporting gap.

#### Geographical Distribution of Commits:

* **UTC +2 (Central Europe):** Remained the most active timezone with 497 commits, though this was down from 819 in July, suggesting a reduction in European activity.
* **UTC -6 (Central Time):** Commit volume fell drastically from 268 to 64, continuing the downward trend seen in July.
* Other zones such as UTC 0, +1, and -4 also saw reductions, reinforcing the overall decline in geographic spread of contributions.

#### Project-Specific Insights:

* **Cardano Node:** Experienced a dramatic increase in commits (68 → 174) and code volume, with 269,450 lines added and 223,357 removed. This likely reflects intensive feature development or infrastructure upgrades.
* **Plutus and Cardano DB Sync:** Both saw increases in commits and longer issue open times, suggesting deeper work is being carried out but potentially with delayed resolutions.
* **Cardano Ledger:** Saw a 56.6% drop in commits, consistent with signs of stabilization or maintenance.
* **Cardano API and Formal Ledger Specs:** Experienced increased issue submissions, but long resolution times (127 and 54 days respectively) may indicate limited bandwidth or complex blockers.

#### Repository Activity:

* The number of active repositories receiving pull requests dropped from 27 in July to 17 in August — a **37% decline**. Pull requests fell from 537 to 402, and submitters dropped from 97 to 62, indicating a consolidation of work into fewer, high-priority codebases.
* **Per Repository Activity** showed focused attention on Cardano Node, Plutus, and DB Sync, while repositories like Cardano Ledger showed reduced activity, suggesting transitions in project focus or completion of prior phases.

### Conclusion

The **August 2024** report reveals a shift from broad-based contribution growth to **deep, strategic development** within core Cardano infrastructure. While fewer contributors and organizations were active compared to July, the depth and intensity of contributions — particularly from IOHK — point to critical system work underway. Longer issue resolution times and fewer PRs across projects suggest a transitional period, possibly between release phases. As the ecosystem matures, maintaining momentum, improving issue throughput, and expanding participation across organizations will be essential for sustaining progress and ensuring resilience across the open-source community.
