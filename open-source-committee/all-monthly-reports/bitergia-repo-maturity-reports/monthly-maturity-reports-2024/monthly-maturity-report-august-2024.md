# Monthly Maturity Report - August 2024

Summary

In August 2024, the Cardano open-source ecosystem entered a phase of focused, high-impact development. While total contributions, pull requests, and active contributors declined across many organizations, the scale of work on core repositories increased dramatically. Key projects like Cardano Node, Plutus, and DB Sync saw significant surges in code volume and targeted activity, signaling a major internal development cycle. Contributions remained led by Input Output (IOHK), though other core contributors such as Tweag and Well-Typed scaled back. The data also points to a slowdown in issue resolution, with rising median open times, suggesting growing complexity or temporary triage delays. Overall, the ecosystem is undergoing a strategic narrowing of focus while sustaining meaningful progress on critical infrastructure.
