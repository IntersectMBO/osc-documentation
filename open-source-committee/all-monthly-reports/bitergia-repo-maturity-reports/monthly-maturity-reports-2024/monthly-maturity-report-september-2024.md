# Monthly Maturity Report - September 2024

### SUMMARY:

In **September 2024**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem maintained steady development momentum while continuing a trend toward **consolidated, infrastructure-focused contributions**. Compared to August, total commit volume held stable, but the number of active repositories and pull requests slightly increased, indicating **broader distribution of effort**. IOHK remained the primary driver of activity, contributing nearly 880 commits and sustaining its leadership in code volume and ecosystem coverage. Meanwhile, Well-Typed significantly ramped up its engagement, nearly doubling its contributions. Issue submission volume surged, especially across previously quieter repositories, suggesting **growing testing, usage, and community interaction**. However, resolution times remain long, highlighting a need for improved triage and support mechanisms. Overall, September reflects a **healthy but maturing development cycle**, marked by focused progress and incremental expansion of participation.
