# Monthly Maturity Report - September 2024

### Summary

In September 2024, the Cardano open-source ecosystem maintained steady development momentum while continuing a trend toward **consolidated, infrastructure-focused contributions**. Compared to August, total commit volume held stable, but the number of active repositories and pull requests slightly increased, indicating **broader distribution of effort**. IOHK remained the primary driver of activity, contributing nearly 880 commits and sustaining its leadership in code volume and ecosystem coverage. Meanwhile, Well-Typed significantly ramped up its engagement, nearly doubling its contributions. Issue submission volume surged, especially across previously quieter repositories, suggesting **growing testing, usage, and community interaction**. However, resolution times remain long, highlighting a need for improved triage and support mechanisms. Overall, September reflects a **healthy but maturing development cycle**, marked by focused progress and incremental expansion of participation.

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions:

* **Input Output (IOHK):** Led once again with 879 contributions, up 3.3% from August. IOHK also added 2.7 million lines of code and modified over 5,900 files, confirming its central role in core system upgrades and maintenance.
* **Well-Typed:** Increased its contributions from 81 to 151, marking an 86% jump. This sharp rise signals deeper involvement, possibly in system tooling, testing, or formal verification.
* **Tweag:** Activity declined significantly, from 136 to 28 contributions, possibly indicating a completed delivery cycle or a pause in involvement.
* **Intersect MBO and Plank:** Contributed in September after showing no activity in August, suggesting renewed or shifting engagement.

***

#### Geographical Distribution of Commits:

* **UTC +2 (Central Europe):** Remained dominant with 542 commits — an increase from 497 — continuing to serve as the ecosystem's primary development hub.
* **UTC -6 and -4 (North America):** Both saw increases, suggesting higher engagement from contributors in these time zones. UTC -6 rose from 64 to 113 commits, while UTC -4 climbed from 70 to 85.
* **UTC 0 (Greenwich Mean Time):** Dropped steeply from 188 to 60 commits (−68%), indicating reduced activity in this previously strong region.

***

#### Project-Specific Insights:

* **Ouroboros Consensus & Cardano CLI:** Saw major spikes in activity. Cardano CLI commits more than doubled, and estimated modified files rose over 400%, suggesting tooling innovation or command-line enhancements.
* **Cardano Node:** Remained the top repository by commits (176), with over 1,000 estimated modified files — a sign of sustained core development.
* **Plutus:** Activity declined across both issues and modified files, indicating a stabilization phase or post-release lull.
* **Cardano Ledger:** Saw a 22% increase in issues and continued to receive steady development attention, maintaining its strategic importance.
* **Issue resolution times** remained long across top projects (averaging 83 days), though **DB Sync notably improved**, dropping from 82 to 47 days.

***

#### Repository Activity:

* Pull request submissions increased slightly (402 → 419), and more repositories received PRs (17 → 20), suggesting **wider distribution of contributions** across the ecosystem.
* The contributor base remained consistent, with 64 PR submitters in September (up from 62), indicating **healthy engagement and stability** among core contributors.
* Focused development continued around a few major projects (node, ledger, consensus), but the **expansion in issue submissions across 30 projects** (up from 10) indicates increasing usage and visibility across the broader ecosystem.

### Conclusion

The **September 2024** report highlights a maturing and strategically aligned open-source ecosystem. While contributions and activity remained largely stable, the **breadth of project engagement expanded**, especially in issues and pull requests. IOHK and Well-Typed led the way in meaningful contributions, while other players returned to the fold or shifted focus. As Cardano advances into deeper infrastructure work, maintaining contributor momentum, reducing issue resolution times, and diversifying organizational participation will be critical to sustaining velocity and reinforcing ecosystem resilience.
