# Monthly Maturity Report - November 2024

### Summary

In **November 2024**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem experienced a phase of **deep, focused development**, marked by reduced surface-level activity but significant growth in code volume. While total commits, pull requests, and issues all declined, **file-level and line-level churn increased sharply**, suggesting a pivot toward substantial refactoring or feature delivery. Key repositories like **Plutus**, **Cardano Ledger**, and **Ouroboros Consensus** saw major increases in modified files, while contributor distribution narrowed slightly. Organizationally, Input Output (IOHK) remained dominant, though community and external contributor participation grew in relative terms. Issue resolution times improved significantly, despite lower submission volume, indicating **better responsiveness** and **operational focus** across key teams.

***

### General Observations

#### Organizational Contributions:

* **Input Output (IOHK):** Led again with 854 contributions (−6.5%), paired with a massive 500K+ lines added and 261K removed — showing a **deep delivery push** across foundational components.
* **Well-Typed:** Increased contributions by nearly 60%, sustaining its role in tooling or compiler-related efforts.
* **Unknown contributors:** Rose from 5 to 22 contributions, suggesting expanded **community engagement or new unaffiliated developers**.
* **Tweag and Cardano Foundation:** Both saw sharp declines, signaling **possible cycle pauses or project completions**.

***

#### Geographical Distribution of Commits:

* **UTC +1 and UTC 0:** Accounted for 67% of all commit activity, with UTC +1 nearly doubling and UTC 0 more than doubling from October — indicating **European dominance** in contributor presence.
* **UTC -7 (Pacific U.S.):** Grew significantly (338%), suggesting **renewed activity in Western North America**.
* **UTC -4 and -6:** Declined further, continuing a **drop in Central and Eastern U.S. development** presence.

***

#### Project-Specific Insights:

* **Plutus, Ledger, CLI, and Ouroboros:** All more than doubled their estimated modified files, showing **increased delivery velocity in high-priority projects**.
* **Cardano-ledger:** Fell in commits (−30%) but doubled in file-level changes, implying **larger updates in fewer commits**.
* **Lsm-tree and Node-tests:** Surged in commit volume, suggesting **expansion of infrastructure and testing frameworks**.

***

#### Repository & Issue Activity:

* PRs fell slightly (437 → 401), while the number of contributors dropped more significantly (−20%) — indicating **focused, high-effort delivery by core teams**.
* Issue submissions dropped across the board (−17.3%), but **resolution times improved by 29%**, with notable gains in IOHK and Cardano Foundation response speed.
* **Ouroboros-consensus** saw a 220% spike in issues, pointing to **intensive development and increased feedback loops**.

***

### Conclusion

The **November 2024** report reveals a period of **consolidation, technical depth, and concentrated delivery** in Cardano’s open-source development. While fewer contributors and organizations were active, the scale and intensity of work increased dramatically across core systems. Faster issue resolution, broader community contributions, and concentrated pull request activity suggest a **highly focused release or integration cycle**. Going forward, sustaining this momentum while expanding contributor diversity and maintaining engagement from ecosystem players will be key to Cardano’s continued OSS maturity.
