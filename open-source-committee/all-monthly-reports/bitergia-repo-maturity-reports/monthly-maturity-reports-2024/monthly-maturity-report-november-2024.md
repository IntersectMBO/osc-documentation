# Monthly Maturity Report - November 2024

### Summary

In **November 2024**, the Cardano open-source ecosystem experienced a phase of **deep, focused development**, marked by reduced surface-level activity but significant growth in code volume. While total commits, pull requests, and issues all declined, **file-level and line-level churn increased sharply**, suggesting a pivot toward substantial refactoring or feature delivery. Key repositories like **Plutus, Cardano Ledger**, and **Ouroboros Consensus** saw major increases in modified files, while contributor distribution narrowed slightly. Organizationally, Input Output (IOHK) remained dominant, though community and external contributor participation grew in relative terms. Issue resolution times improved significantly, despite lower submission volume, indicating **better responsiveness** and **operational focus** across key teams.
