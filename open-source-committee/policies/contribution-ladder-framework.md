### Executive Summary

The Contribution Ladder is a foundational framework designed to enhance the Cardano ecosystem by providing a structured general pathway for contributors to progress from newcomers to core maintainers. This framework fosters skill development, ensures high-quality contributions, and supports community engagement while promoting the decentralized and collaborative ethos of Cardano. Each project is welcome to utilize this approach to streamline general pathways to advancing contributions and contributors themselves to their distinct use cases.\
(Note: This framework is a general process and projects are welcome to adapt to their specific use cases, projects under Intersect are advised to inform the Open Source Committee of the made adaptations for record keeping)

Key Highlights:

* **Four Progression Stages:** New Contributor, Committer, Trusted Committer, and Core Maintainer, each with distinct responsibilities and milestones.
* **Support and Recognition:** Contributors are guided through mentorship, rewarded for their efforts, and recognized for their impact.
* **Ecosystem Benefits:** Encourages participation, fosters leadership, and sustains the ecosystem through community-driven growth and governance.

The Contribution Ladder aims to provide transparency and clarity, ensuring contributors are empowered to succeed while aligning their growth with the long-term vision of the Cardano ecosystem.
