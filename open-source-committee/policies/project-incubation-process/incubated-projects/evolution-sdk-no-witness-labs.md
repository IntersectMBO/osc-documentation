### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: What is the Incubation Program at Intersect?\
A: The Incubation Program is Intersect’s framework for nurturing early-stage open source projects in the Cardano ecosystem. It provides governance support, technical guidance, and community visibility, helping projects grow from Incubation → Growth → Maturity while staying vendor-neutral and community-driven structures by support from the OSC, TSC, and OSO respectfully.

Q: Why was Evolution SDK chosen as the first incubated project?\
A: Evolution SDK addresses one of Cardano’s most pressing gaps: developer experience. It provides a complete, TypeScript-first framework for transaction building, wallet integration, and scaling—critical infrastructure that accelerates DApp development. It’s already adopted across multiple projects, making it a strong candidate for long-term ecosystem value

Q: What makes Evolution SDK unique?\
A: Unlike fragmented or single-provider tools, Evolution SDK offers:

* Multi-provider support (Maestro, Blockfrost, Koios, and more)
* Cross-network flexibility (Mainnet, Preprod, Preview, and custom networks)
* TypeScript-first design for type safety and easy onboarding
* A modular approach, letting teams use only what they need.

Q: How does incubation benefit the project?\
A: Incubation ensures Evolution SDK is developed under Intersect’s open source governance, protecting its vendor-neutrality. It also provides access to Intersect’s technical steering committees, ecosystem connections, and resources to accelerate adoption.

Q: What is the roadmap for Evolution SDK?\
A: Evolution SDK’s roadmap includes:

* Phase 2: Transaction builder, UTXO selection, and multi-asset support.
* Phase 3: Wallet integrations, CIP-30 compatibility, and smart contract support.
* Phase 4: Hydra integration, DeFi utilities, CLI tools, and a VS Code extension

Q: How does Evolution SDK fit into Cardano’s ecosystem?\
A: The SDK supports improvements to the developer experience on Cardano, removing complexity around transactions and infrastructure. This enables wallets, DeFi protocols, governance tools, and other projects to build faster, with more reliability, while lowering onboarding barriers for developers entering the Cardano ecosystem.

Q: How can developers get involved?\
A: Developers can contribute via the[ Evolution SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/no-witness-labs/evolution-sdk) or by following the contribution guide. The project also accepts sponsorship through GitHub Sponsors to support its maintainers.\
\
Q: How is Evolution SDK different from Lucid Evolution?\
A: Evolution SDK is a complete SDK developed by No Witness Labs. It is focused on covering professional DApp development. It is moving away from CML, and it is entirely written in Effects for maximum control and safety.

Lucid Evolution is a TypeScript library developed by Anastasia Labs. Its primary focus was to provide DApps and projects with an alternative option after the Chang HF caused the original Lucid library to stop functioning due to some breaking changes.
