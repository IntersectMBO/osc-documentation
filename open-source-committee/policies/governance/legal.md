<summary>Rationale</summary>

Apache 2.0 is a permissive license that is widely deployed and backed by a strong community. Apache 2.0 allows users the freedom to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of it under the terms of the license, without any concern about royalties.

A key advantage of the Apache 2.0 license is that it contains provisions that are absent from many other free and open source licenses (including the MIT license) and which provide more clarity to contributors and users alike.

However, for text we can typically be much less restrictive. For this a permissive license like Creative Commons is much more appropriate.
