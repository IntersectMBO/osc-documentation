# 🔐 Security Policy

## Intersect Security Policy | Security Council

### Roles and bodies

#### Open Source Committee

The Open Source Committee (OSC) is responsible for setting security policies, but not for administering them. The OSC should not be treated as a trusted body at any point.



The responsibilities of the OSC with respect to security are:

* Ensure that there is sufficient security policy in place and that this policy is reflected accurately in the governance structures for Intersect projects.

#### Security Council

The Security Council (SC) is a working group reporting to the Intersect Technical Steering Committee. Members of the Security Council primarily need to be highly trustworthy since they are responsible for overseeing the rest of the security processes. They should be appointed by Intersect, and not elected by Intersect members.



The Security Council should be trustworthy enough to receive sensitive information, but they should generally only be given it when they need to know it.\


The responsibilities of the Security Council are:

* Approve all individuals who are given access to sensitive information
  * This may involve some kind of vetting
* Appoint and manage the Security Manager
* At least one member of the Security Council should be available and qualified to act as a backup Security Manager
* Appoint and manage Responders
* Insulate the rest of Intersect from access to sensitive information
* Ensure that contributors are made aware of security issues where necessary
* Ensure that information on security issues is restricted to those who need to know, and only provided to the extent that is necessary for each role&#x20;
* Report on responses to security issues to the Intersect Board

**Appointments**

Appointments are made by Intersect. The process is to be agreed, but there will likely be a call for nominations followed by a private decision.



Qualifications for the Security Council:

* Member of Intersect
* Some kind of vetting: [https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/about/security-council](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/about/security-council)
* Experience of dealing with security incidents is desirable
* Relevant technical experience is desirable but not absolutely required

#### Security Manager

The Security Manager (SM) is a specific individual reporting to the Security Working Group. They should be an employee of Intersect, or other highly vetted individual. The Security Manager is responsible for most procedural aspects relating to security issues. They are primarily a trustworthy project manager, rather than necessarily being technically qualified.

The responsibilities of the Security Manager are:

* Receive reports of security issues, acknowledge them in a timely manner, triage them if possible, and direct them to the appropriate Responder.
* In collaboration with the Responder, assess and classify the severity of each issue.
* Report on responses to security issues to the Security Working Group.
  * Sensitive information should be passed up only when and to the extent that is necessary
* Ensure that security issues are followed up on
* Ensure that security-related processes are followed correctly
* Create private channels as needed to discuss or manage security concerns
* Ensure that communication is maintained with the Finder of an issue and that they are aware of the responsible disclosure policy
* Handle any other bureaucracy, e.g. lifecycle tracking, getting CVEs, etc.



**Appointments**

Appointments are made by the Security Council. The process is to be confirmed.\


Qualifications for the Security Manager:

* Employee of Intersect (or individual under continuity contract)
* Some kind of vetting: [https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/about/security-council](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee/about/security-council)
* Experience of dealing with security incidents desirable
* Relevant technical experience desirable but not required

#### Finder

The Finder is the person (or persons) who finds and reports a potential security issue. The Finder will usually be external to Intersect, but they could be an employee of Intersect, or even the Security Manager themselves (if e.g. they read a CVE report and realise that it applies to software that is curated by Intersect).

#### Insider

An Insider is an individual who is cleared by the SC to know about sensitive information about a specific project or technical area (security issues, technical reports discussing potential security problems, etc.). The identities of Insiders should not be known except to the SO, the SC, and some number of Insiders as needed (e.g. by the Responder for an issue. Generally, Insiders on the same project should likely know each others’ identities).

Insider status should be reviewed regularly and should expire quickly if contributors become inactive or if they show themselves to be insufficiently trustworthy.

Not all Insiders working on an issue need be considered equal; it is up to the Responder to determine which Insiders should be granted which access to information concerning an issue and when.

If a project needs Insiders, then at least one Maintainer should be an Insider.

Insiders should be asked to sign a security-specific NDA, with limited scope relating to security issues.

The responsibilities of an Insider are to:

* Act responsibly with sensitive information
* Follow the instructions of the Responder, which may include additional information discipline

**Appointments**

Insiders will be nominated by the PMC for a project, and then vetted by the Security Council

Qualifications for Insiders:

* Be a Committer on the project

#### Responder

A Responder is an Insider who is the “Directly Responsible Individual” for the resolution (fix or mitigation) of a technical issue. The Responder for an issue need not remain constant; it may make sense to pass it on to someone else at some points.

The Responder is responsible for the complete resolution of the issue. They must ensure that the issue gets all the way to being resolved (including releases, following up to make sure mitigations have been applied etc.)

The position of Responder is a fluid one: if another Insider takes over an issue, then they become the Responder. Some number of default Responders for certain technical areas should be maintained by the SM to ensure that they know who to talk to when there is a problem.\
The responsibilities of a Responder are:

* Receive and triage reports of security issues relevant to their area
  * Set the severity level of the issue in discussion with the Security Officer
* Ensure that issues are resolved
  * Formulate a plan to address the issue, bringing in Insiders as needed to help plan or execute
  * Liaise with the SC to bring on additional Insiders if necessary
  * Communicate with the Finder as needed to keep them up to date or seek additional information
* Handle information discipline relating to issues
  * Formulate a communication strategy, if necessary, for referring to an issue in public channels
    * Might be very simple, e.g. “we can acknowledge the issue but no further details”
  * Ascertain and manage which Insiders need what access to the issue, in collaboration with the SM
* Report on their activities to the SM

### Policies

#### Bringing in new Insiders

Insiders should strictly be brought in after vetting by the SC.

In some cases there may be urgency to bring someone in, e.g. if they are doing independent investigation as a community member. In cases such as this we should ask the individual to follow information discipline and promise to move towards making them an Insider on this topic. If they won’t stick to that, they probably aren’t trustworthy enough to bring in anyway.

#### Issue reporting

The lifecycle of an issue is:

* An issue is reported by the Finder to the Security Manager
* The Security Manager reports this to the Security Council, and then designates a Responder to triage it (this may lead to the Responder changing)
* The Responder collaborates with relevant Insiders to create a plan to address the issue, and to implement it
* The Security Manager monitors the process and ensures that everything is progressing properly and that everyone is kept informed
* The issue is resolved or mitigated
* A confidential report is produced on the issue, explaining its nature, possible impact, defined severity level, and its resolution or mitigation if there is one
* Once the issue is satisfactorily resolved or mitigated so that no threat exists, a public report may be produced in line with the principle of responsible disclosure

**Severity**

In general, security issues should be treated as maximally severe until triaged by a suitably competent Responder.

**Responsible disclosure**

Following the [material in the Cardano Engineering Handbook](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-engineering-handbook/policy/security/index.html#security). Embargo periods may vary depending on the project: for Cardano we will ask people to wait until the fix is in mainnet, which may be a long time.  Where an issue reveals other attack vectors, this period may be extended until the threat is deemed to no longer exist.

**Example**

Here’s a longer worked example of what an issue lifecycle might look like.\


* Fred (the Finder) reports a serious security issue in Cardano by emailing the security report email address
* Janet (the Security Manager) receives the email, acknowledges receipt to Fred, notifies the SC, and looks for a sensible Responder to start with. Based on a cursory look at the issue, they think it may be related to the consensus layer, so they contact a Responder from that project (Carrie).
* Carrie understands the issue more deeply and instead suggests that Alison take on the Responder role this time.
* Alison triages the issue, tags it as medium severity, and pulls in Xenia and Will (Insiders) to form a plan and fix the issue.
* The team comes up with a fix and also a mitigation.
* Alison and Janet update Fred and the SC on the progress. Fred is informed that while the fix will take until the next HF, once the mitigation is deployed we can responsibly disclose the issue.
* Alison liaises with some SPO Insiders to test the mitigation and later the fix.
* It turns out that there are performance considerations. Alison goes to the SC to ask to bring in one of the performance team as an Insider so they can help.
* Xenia and Will write and test the fix on a private fork, and merge it into the main codebase surreptitiously.
* The full fix goes out in the next HF.
* Once Alison is satisfied that the HF successfully mitigates the issue, and that its disclosure would not create any further security risks, the issue can be disclosed publicly.&#x20;

#### Information discipline

Information about security issues should be strictly limited to the minimum number of people who need to know about it, and to the extent that is necessary for them to deal with the issue. The Responder is responsible for making sure the policy is clear for any given issue.&#x20;

**Redacting**

Project Maintainers are responsible for ensuring that messages which reveal sensitive information publicly are quickly redacted. In particular:

* Care should be taken when developing code fixes so that the nature of the issue is not revealed prematurely
* Code may need to be obfuscated
* Code comments that reveal the issue should be eliminated
* Github issues should be edited or deleted
* Public Slack messages should be deleted

Users who post such information should be cautioned, and repeated offences should be considered grounds for a ban from contributing to code repositories. Poor information hygiene with regard to security issues should be a mark against an individual being assigned insider status.

#### Project development

**Security audits**

Project Maintainers are responsible for ensuring that any contributions which touch on security are carefully assessed. This may include

* Design review by external experts
* Security audits of the specification, design and/or code\


Or other measures as appropriate.

**Documentation**

All Intersect projects should have a SECURITY.md pointing to this policy.

#### Disaster recovery for Cardano

Follow and enhance the [disaster recovery plan](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/cardano-disaster-recovery-plan/). We may need to fill in some blanks here, e.g. actually how off-chain coordination is done.

### Systems

#### Issue reporting

We want at least a durable mailing list for reporting issues to, although maybe only the Security Manager can see it.

#### Issue tracking

Some kind of private issue tracking system with visibility and permissions levels. Maybe also audit logs?

Github Security Advisories are actually pretty decent for this.

#### Private document store

Some kind of private document store with permission levels so that Insiders can see private docs.

#### Private communication channels

Private channels for:

* The Security Council
* The Security Manager to talk to&#x20;
  * Responders (email?)
  * Finders (email?)
* Responders to talk to Insiders
  * Individually
  * As a team when tackling a problem
* Responders to talk to Finders (email?)
