### Abstract:

The incubation life cycle described below is written by Intersectâ€™s Open Source Office, is endorsed by Intersectâ€™s Technical Steering Committee and is implemented by Intersectâ€™s Open Source Committee, these groups henceforth will be identified as [OSO](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso), [TSC](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee), and [OSC](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee) respectively. &#x20;

This framework emphasizes sustainable growth, community engagement, and adherence to governance practices. By establishing clear milestones for early project development, technical infrastructure, and community formation, the Incubation Framework provides essential resources and guidance to help projects attract contributors, build solid foundations, and align with Cardanoâ€™s long-term open-source goals

\
Projects looking for support should fall within the Incubation phase and have a trajectory to move through each phase with the exception of Archive unless the Project fails to succeed. After successful completion of the metrics set forth in the Incubation phase, Projects will move to Growth, followed by Maturity and Maintenance. If a Project experiences or begins to display points of failure in either the Growth or Maturity phases it will proceed to the Decline phase where there is an opportunity to return to the Growth stage upon achieving the requirements metrics and reporting. Failure to adapt the project within the guidelines of the Decline phase, a Project then transitions to Archive and prepares to public archive within an established timeframe.
