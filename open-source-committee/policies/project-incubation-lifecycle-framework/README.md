***

As Cardanoâ€™s journey in the Voltaire era continues, the Open Source Committeeâ€™s strategy empowers community-led and sustainability-driven decisions, shaping our path forward in open source development

## General Context

This document defines and details the Intersectâ€™s Project Lifecycle Framework. It is specifically developed to implement the strategic directives outlined in the Open Source Strategy adopted by OSC on June 7, 2024.&#x20;

This framework introduces a structured approach for projects, from inception to potential sunset. Each stage of a projectâ€™s lifecycle â€” Incubation, Growth, Maturity, Decline, and Abandonment â€” is aimed to be aligned with Cardanoâ€™s commitment to open source development, technological excellence, and community empowerment.

The development of this lifecycle framework is a response to the need for a dynamic management tool that adapts to the evolving requirements of projects. It has been crafted through a collaborative effort involving diverse stakeholders, ensuring that it not only supports projects in achieving their individual objectives but also contributes to the broader goals of the Cardano community.

By referencing the strategic pillars outlined in the OSCâ€™s Strategy for Cardano Open Source initiatives, this framework ensures consistency in approach and alignment with Cardano's mission and vision. It offers a detailed, action-oriented guide that complements the strategic document, focusing on the practical aspects of project management, monitoring, and evolution within a structured lifecycle context.

In essence, the Project Lifecycle Framework is designed to operationalize the strategic insights from the OSC strategy document, providing a clear, actionable path for managing the lifecycle of projects. It embodies our commitment to fostering sustainable project development and ensuring that every initiative under the Cardano umbrella is equipped to thrive in an ever-changing technological landscape.



## Summary

The Project Lifecycle Framework designed for the Open Source Committee Cardano is a strategic tool aimed at managing the evolution of projects from their inception through to their maturity and potential sunset. This framework provides structured guidance through defined stages: Incubation, Growth, Maturity, Decline, and Abandonment. Each stage is equipped with specific goals, criteria, actions, and metrics to ensure that projects not only thrive but also align with the broader objectives of sustainability and community leadership inherent to Cardano's philosophy. By implementing this framework, we aim to enhance project outcomes, foster robust community engagement, and ensure the long-term viability of initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem.\


## Incubation

### Definition

This is the initial phase of a project, characterized by setting up the foundation and infrastructure necessary for future development and growth. Projects in this stage typically have early stage (or even no) codebases, minimal documentation, and a small number of contributors (1-3 usually).

* Developing a partnership with educational institutions to use the project as a teaching tool, providing a new avenue for utilization
* Creating a detailed archive of the projectâ€™s development history and major achievements to serve as a resource for future developers



## Archive

The final phase in the Project Lifecycle Framework is the Archive stage. This stage is reached when a decision is made to officially end active development and support for the project. Although it marks the end of active project lifecycle, managing this stage effectively is important to ensure a respectful and strategic closure.

### Definition

The Archive stage occurs when a project is officially retired or abandoned. This equals no further development, support, or maintenance planned. The project may still be used or referenced, but it no longer evolves.

### Criteria

* Official decision to stop development and support
* No active contributors aboard
* Minimal to no user engagement
* Legacy code and documentation remain available, but are no longer updated

### Goals

* Ensure a smooth transition for users and contributors to other solutions or projects
* Preserve the project's legacy and contributions for the communityâ€™s benefit
* Minimize negative impacts on the community and Cardanoâ€™s image

### Actions

1. Communicate decisions transparently - clearly communicate the decision to abandon the project to all stakeholders, explaining the reasons and outlining the next steps



2. Communicate the project's achievements - compile and publish documentation of the projectâ€™s history, key achievements, and impact.



3. Preserve code / repos - ensure that all code, documentation, and other resources are archived in an accessible format for future reference&#x20;



4. Celebrate the project - organize an event or create content to celebrate the achievements of the project and its community, acknowledging the contributions of everyone involved



### Monitoring and Evaluation

* **Metrics:** effectiveness of communication about the abandonment, user satisfaction with provided transitions, accessibility of preserved materials.
* **Review:** post-abandonment checks to ensure all documented resources are maintained and accessible, and feedback from the community is addressed

### Examples

An example could be a scenario where a project focused on a specific framework is being abandoned due to the emergence of another, more modern technology. Actions could include:

* Hosting a final webinar to discuss the projectâ€™s timeline, its impact, and to thank the community
* Collaborating with a technology education nonprofit to preserve the projectâ€™s outputs as educational materials
* Setting up an open archive of all project materials, ensuring that the knowledge isn't lost.



By thoughtfully managing the Abandonment stage, the project can conclude on a positive note, ensuring its contributions are recognized, and the community is respectfully transitioned to new opportunities. This careful closure not only respects the legacy of the project but also maintains trust and goodwill among the Cardanoâ€™s watchers.
