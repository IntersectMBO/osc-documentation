### Abstract:

The incubation life cycle described below is written by Intersect‚Äôs Open Source Office, is endorsed by Intersect‚Äôs Technical Steering Committee and is implemented by Intersect‚Äôs Open Source Committee, these groups henceforth will be identified as [OSO](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso), [TSC](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-technical-steering-committee), and [OSC](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee) respectively. &#x20;

This framework emphasizes sustainable growth, community engagement, and adherence to governance practices. By establishing clear milestones for early project development, technical infrastructure, and community formation, the Incubation Framework provides essential resources and guidance to help projects attract contributors, build solid foundations, and align with Cardano‚Äôs long-term open-source goals

Projects looking for support should fall within the Incubation phase and have a trajectory to move through each phase with the exception of Archive unless the Project fails to succeed. After successful completion of the metrics set forth in the Incubation phase, Projects will move to Growth, followed by Maturity and Maintenance. If a Project experiences or begins to display points of failure in either the Growth or Maturity phases it will proceed to the Decline phase where there is an opportunity to return to the Growth stage upon achieving the requirements metrics and reporting. Failure to adapt the project within the guidelines of the Decline phase, a Project then transitions to Archive and prepares to public archive within an established timeframe.&#x20;

## Executive Summary

The Project Incubation Framework, from Intersect‚Äôs Open Source Office, serves as a guide for new and emerging projects within Cardano‚Äôs open-source ecosystem, supporting their journey from initial concept to a sustainable, community-backed development. Recognizing the unique needs of early-stage open-source projects, the Incubation Framework emphasizes building a robust infrastructure, developing community engagement channels, and establishing governance alignment with Intersect‚Äôs Open Source Committee (OSC) standards.

The Incubation phase is critical for establishing the core elements of a project‚Äôs success. This framework provides a structured pathway with key areas of focus:

1. Stage Definition: The Incubation phase acts as a sandbox environment where new projects set up essential infrastructure, outline their goals, and test their ideas. By providing a clear roadmap and an early technical setup, projects are equipped to establish a stable base for future development.
2. Criteria for Entry: Projects eligible for Incubation are typically newly created or recently forked, with a limited codebase, minimal documentation, and a small contributor base. Projects must show alignment with Cardano‚Äôs open-source governance standards and a clear vision and roadmap for development that adds to or improves features/products in the ecosystem.
3. Goals: Incubation focuses on building a solid technical foundation, engaging the community, and creating comprehensive documentation. Projects are guided to establish essential infrastructure, define a clear vision, set up processes for feedback collection, and foster both growth and engagement.
4. Actions:
5.
   * Project Vision and Roadmap: Host stakeholder workshops and perform a SWOT analysis to establish a strategic vision, identify potential challenges, and set achievable milestones.
   * Community Formation: Develop early community engagement via various channels (e.g., Discord, GitHub discussions) and host introductory events to build an initial user and contributor base.
   * Technical Foundation: Establish a repository that includes the core code and connections to Core-Cardano thereto, with version control, CI/CD pipelines, and basic [Security](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/policies/security-policy) practices. Documentation, such as a README and contributor guidelines, are written to make the project accessible to new contributors. Details: [OSC Governance Policy](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/policies/governance).
   * Initial Marketing and Outreach: Launch initial marketing efforts to raise awareness, including blog posts, videos, and participation in relevant open-source communities and tech events.
6. Monitoring and Evaluation: Throughout Incubation, metrics are tracked to gauge progress, community engagement, and technical stability. Monthly reviews provide a feedback loop to refine strategies based on user and contributor input, ensuring the project stays aligned with its objectives. Key metrics include active contributor count, code commit frequency, community engagement levels, and roadmap milestone completion.

The Project Incubation Framework fosters the growth of sustainable open-source projects that align with Cardano‚Äôs mission of community empowerment and technical excellence. Through strategic planning, resource allocation, and structured monitoring, the Incubation phase provides a robust foundation that enables projects to transition smoothly to the next stages of growth, ultimately enhancing Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem and supporting the broader open-source movement.

    * Recognition of Key Contributors: Highlight and thank significant contributors, such as maintainers, long-term community members, and early supporters, with acknowledgments in the project‚Äôs final communication and documentation.
    * Commemorative Content: Create a blog post, timeline, or video documenting the project‚Äôs milestones and achievements to honor its impact within the Cardano ecosystem.

***

* Monitoring and Final Review
*
  * Goal: Ensure that all closure-related actions are complete and that resources remain accessible for future reference.
  * Key Actions:
  *
    - Post-Abandonment Checks: Conduct a final review to confirm that all documentation, archiving, and community communications are finalized and available as planned.
    - Legacy Access Reviews: Periodically check that archived resources (e.g., code repositories, documentation) remain accessible and in good condition, ensuring they meet the needs of potential users or researchers.

* Outcome
*
  * Completion of Project Lifecycle:
  *
    * The Abandonment Phase marks the official end of the project lifecycle. With all resources archived, the project‚Äôs legacy is preserved, allowing the community to honor its contributions while freeing resources for new initiatives.
  * Community and Ecosystem Impact:
  *
    * By completing this phase transparently and respectfully, the community‚Äôs trust and goodwill are maintained, setting a positive example for future projects within the ecosystem.
* Specific Criteria Reviewed:
*
  * Zero or Near-Zero Contributor Activity
* Metric: No new commits, pull requests, or code contributions over a defined period (e.g., six months or more).
* Indicator: Lack of contributor activity is a primary signal of abandonment, suggesting no one is maintaining or improving the project.
* No Issue Resolution or Triage
*
  * Metric: No issues closed, triaged, or responded to within several months or longer.
  * Indicator: When issues and bugs remain unaddressed, it‚Äôs clear that there is no support structure left for the project.
* Complete Decline in Community Interaction
*
  * Metric: No new comments, discussions, or support questions being addressed on GitHub, forums, or community channels.
  * Indicator: A complete lack of community interaction indicates that both the user base and maintainers have disengaged from the project.
* Unmaintained Dependencies and Security Vulnerabilities
*
